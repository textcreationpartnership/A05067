            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>¶ A copie of the Letters which my Lord the Prince of Orange, ſent vnto the Kigns and Potentates of Chriſtendome. (<g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>)</head>
            <p>SIr, I doubt not, but that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectie hath bin aduertiſed of a certaine Proſcription, which the King of Spaine, hath appointed to be publiſhed againct me, becauſe he hath cauſed the ſame to be ſpread abroade in all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and hath ſent it alſo into diuers quarters of christendome. I and all my verie good freendes haue thought, that I could not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently defende myne honor (which I am aduiſed and purpoſed not to hazard or indaunger for anie thing) but by ſetting a iust defence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this vniuſt Proſcription. In regard whereof, I haue preſented vnto my Lords, the estates of theſe countries, my aunſwere: which aunſwere alſo (for the maintenaunce of myne honor and reputation, amongeſt the Princes &amp; Potentates of Europe, who in reſpect of their preheminences and dignities, are the ſuccours of poore Princes and diſtreſſed noble men) I haue bin bolde to ſende vnto them, and to you (Syr) particularlie, moſt humblie beſeeching your Maieſtie, that, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you haue ſeene it, you would yeelde like iudgement thereof, as it hath pleaſed my Lords the Eſtates, who haue bin moſt faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of all myne actions, to do, and to eſteeme and iudge thereof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (as it ſhall pleaſe your Maiestie to take knowledge of it) by their aduiſe and counſell, which alſo is annexed to my ſaid defence. And becauſe (Sir) your Maieſtie may thinke it ſtraunge, that the King of Spaine, hauing heretofore violently taken from me all my goods, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I had put my gouernementes into the hands of the Dutches of Parma, then the Gouerneſſe of this eſtate, and had withdrawen my ſelfe into the countrey of Germanie, the place of my natiuitie, where I kept my ſelfe peaceablie among my brethren, kinsfolkes &amp; freends, as alſo I had fully purpoſed ſo to continue: and that, hauing at the ſame time, conueyed or caried awaie from the ſcholes, my ſonne the Countie of Bueren, and both contrarie to the priuiledges of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and againſt his owne othe cauſing him to be caried priſoner into Spaine, wher he is as yet cruelly kept captiue: and beſides, hauing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured me to be condemned to death, by the Duke of Alua his owne officer: becauſe (I ſaie) your Maieſtie may thinke it ſtraunge, that for
<pb facs="tcp:7223:3"/>all theſe reaſons (which were neuertheleſſe verie great and waightie) I haue not hitherto publiſhed anie defence, which was directed to the ſaid King, or might directly concerne him, which thing notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I do at this preſent and declare thereby, that the faultes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the King of Spaine mindeth to charge me, belong vnto him ſelfe. I do therfore moſt hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blie beſeche your Maieſtie (Sir) that before you iudge of this my writing, you would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the qualitie both of the crimes and faultes, where with I am charged by this Proſcription, and alſo the qualitie of mine owne perſon. For, if the King of Spaine was content to withhold from me my ſonne and my goods, which he hath in his poſſeſſion, &amp; further to offer (as at this preſent he doth) fiue &amp; twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thouſand crownes for my head, and to promiſe to make ſuch noble as ſhould murther me, and to pardon them all the faultes whatſoeuer that they could haue committed before that time: no man ſhould thinke it euill in me, that I haue attempted by all the meanes I could, (as in deede heretofore I haue done) to preſerue my ſelfe and myne, and to inable my ſelfe what I could, to enter againe into that which is myne owne: and that I haue followed that order and courſe of life that I haue done. But further the King of Spaine, hauing al the world thorowe publiſhed, that I am <hi>a publike plague, an enemie of the world, vnthankfull, vnfaithfull, a traytor, and a wicked perſon:</hi> theſe are ſuch iniuries (Sir) that no gentleman, no though he were of the baſeſt of the king of Spaines naturall ſubiectes, can or ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: in ſo much (Sir) that though I were one of his ſimple and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute vaſſals, who oweth homage vnto him by honor, yet ſo it is, that by ſuch a ſentence, and ſo vniust in all and euerie part thereof: I alſo hauing bin by him, ſpoiled of my landes and Lordſhippes, in respect of which, I ſhould heretofore haue taken an othe vnto him, I might haue helde my ſelfe abſolued and free from all my bandes towardes him, &amp; haue aſſaied alſo (which thing euen nature hath taught euerie one) by all the meanes I could to maintaine myne honor, which ought to be to me and to all noble men, more deare than life and goods. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſeeing it hath pleaſed God, to ſhewe me this great grace, that I am borne a free Lord, not holding of anie other but of the Empire, as do the Princes and other free Lordes of Germanie and Italie: and further ſeeing that I beare the title, and haue the name <hi>of an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and free Prince,</hi> though in deede my Princedome be not verie great: yea whatſoeuer it be, I not being his natural ſubiect, neither ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing helde anie thing of him, but by reaſon of my Seignuries &amp; Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippes,
<pb facs="tcp:7223:3"/>ſhippes, of which notwithſtanding he hath wholly diſpoſſeſſed me: it hath ſeemed vnto me, that I could not defende myne honor, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or content my neare kinsfolkes, ſundrie Princes (to whom this is my honor that I am lincked) and my whole posteritie, but in aunſwering by publike writing to this accuſation, which in the preſence of all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, is publiſhed and ſet out against me. And though I haue not bin able to do it, without touching his honor, I hope notwithstanding (Sir) that your Maieſtie will impute it, rather to the inforcement, that the qualitie and hainouſnes of this Proſcription hath laide vppon me, than to my nature or will. For as concerning this point, that ſome men maie thinke it ſtraunge, that I do after this ſorte defende my ſelfe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I haue ſometimes heretofore helde of him ſundrie landes and Lordſhippes, for aunſwere thereto, I will most humblie beſeeche your Maiestie, to conſider the hainouſnes of the iniurie, that is done me, which a right noble man will neuer in deede abide: alſo that I am not his naturall ſubiect, and, as concerning my fees and penſions, that he hath ſpoiled me of them. But ſuppoſe that I had alwaies enioyed them: yet ſo it is, that the ſame lawe which he vſeth towardes others, ſhould not be denied to me.<note place="margin">In the letter ſent to the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch King, it is vvritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: He holdeth of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie.</note> He holdeth of the French King in loyaultie and homage, and euen as the vaſſall doth of his Lord, the Countie or Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Charollois: and yet for all that he ceaſſeth not, to make warr against the crowne of Fraunce, yea he neuer leaueth of continuallie to practiſe and deuiſe, ſomewhat against the ſame. He taketh this as a ſure foundation or rule, that, being a ſoueraigne gouernor in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, it is lawfull for him, to reuenge him ſelfe of the wrong, which he pretended was done vnto him, by the late French King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of most noble memorie. When he made warre against the Pope Caraffa, becauſe as a vaſſall he helde of him the kingdomes of Sicilia and Naples, he publiſhed his defence, by which he mainteined, that he was abſolued from his othe, becauſe that the Pope kept not him ſelfe, within the termes or pointes that the Lord oweth to his vaſſall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the feodall lawes which are mutuall, and respect as well the one, as the other. Now (Sir) there is nothing ſo naturall or kindlie, as, that euerie one ſhould in his owne cauſe, receaue the verie ſelfeſame rule and order, that he would haue an other man to receaue or allow of. Wherefore he ſhould not thinke it ſtraunge, that I, being ſo maine wayes reuiled &amp; iniuried by him, and not being his ſubiect, that I, I ſay, do ayde my ſelfe, with the meanes that God hath giuen me, and with which he hath bin willing to helpe him ſelfe against his Lordes, who

               </gap>euer, that draweth nigh to the wrong which I haue ſuffered at his hande: yea he ſhould not thinke it ſtraunge, that I vſe againſt him that reprochefull note, hy which he aſſayeth to marke as it were in the forehead, both me and my race. And becauſe my Lords the Eſtates, (who haue more nighly knowen the trueth of all that is contained in this my defence, and haue appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſame) haue yeelded vnto me ſufficient testimonie inough tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching my life past: I do moſt humblie alſo beſeeche your Maieſtie (Sir) in approuing this ſame myne aunſwere, to beleeue that I am not, either a traytour or wicked perſon, but that I am, (thankes be to God for it) a noble man, of a verie good and moſt auncient houſe, yea a good man and true in euerie thing that I promiſe, not vnthankeful, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, nor hauing committed anie thing, whereby a Lord or Knight of my ſtate &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenaunce, may receaue anie reproche or ſhame: moſt humblie beſeeching you, to holde and account me, in the number of your most humble ſeruauntes. And thus hauing moſt humblie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted my ſelfe vnto your Maieſtie, I will pray God (Sir) to giue it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with perfect health, a moſt bleſſed and moſt long life.</p>

            <p>MY Lordes, ye haue heretofore ſeene a certaine ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the forme of a Proſcription, which was ſent by the King of Spaine, and afterwards publiſhed by the appointment and order of the Prince of Parma: and howe by the meanes thereof, myne enemies haue againſt all right and reaſon attempted, grieuouſly to touche and to taint myne honor, and to cauſe my former actions, to be thought euil and wicked: wherin I haue bin very willing and deſirous, to take the aduice and counſell of ſundrie notable perſonages, and men of great name and calling, yea of the principall counſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and wyſe men of this countrey.

And nowe I do greatly reioyce my ſelfe, and yeelde immoatal thankes vnto our good God, &amp; I haue great occaſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentement and quietnes, ſeeing that he ſuffereth me to be made ſo rare, and ſo noble, and ſo excellent a marke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by this cruell and barbarous Proſcription, yea ſuch a one, as the like hath not bin heard in theſe countries, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended amongeſt all people &amp; nations, for their ſingular and incredible courteſie. For albeit that nothing be more to be wiſhed of a man, than the race and courſe of his life, to be ſound, bleſſed, proſperous, and vpright, without any daſhe, blowe, ſtumbling, or any wicked incountring notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding if all things had fallen out vnto me, as I would haue wiſhed, and that I had not incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred, with the hatred of the Spaniſhe nation and his adherentes, I ſhould haue loſt the gaine of this teſtimonie, which my very enemies haue yeelded me, &amp; which I take to be the moſt excellent flowre of glorie, that I had bin able to haue deſired, to haue bin crowned with, before my death. For what in this worlde can be more acceptable, and that ſpecially to him, who hath enterpriſed ſo great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a work, as is the libertie of ſo good a people, oppreſſed by ſo wicked people, than to be deadly hated of his enimies, yea ſuch enimies, as are withal the enimies of the countrey, &amp; by their owne verie mouth and confeſsion, to receaue a ſure teſtimonie, of his faithfulnes towardes his owne people, and of conſtancie, againſt tyraunts &amp; diſturbers of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon peace? in ſo much, that the Spaniards and their adherents, thinking
<pb facs="tcp:7223:7"/>in deede to do me diſpleaſure, haue done me many pleaſures, as by this infamous Proſcription, they haue thought to hurt me more than before, and yet they haue made me more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and giuen me more contentednes of minde. For I haue not only thereby receaued that profit, but they haue opened vnto me a more large field to defend my ſelfe, than I durſt euer be bolde to deſire, that ſo I might cauſe all the world to know, the equitie and iuſtice of my enterpriſes, &amp; by it leaue vnto my poſteritie, an example of vertue meete to be followed by all thoſe, that would not diſhonour the nobilitie of their aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, from whence we are deſcended, &amp; of whom, not ſo much as one onely, hath at any time fauoured tyrannie, but all they haue loued the libertie of the people, amongeſt whom they haue borne office and had authoritie. I haue no occaſion to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine, that I haue not had heretofore, matter large ynough to ſpeake of my ſelfe, and to reproue the foule and hayuous, faultes of myne enemies: but neither would ſhamefaſtnes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me my ſelfe to ſing and ſet out myne owne prayſes, which ſurely is a hard matter not to do, whatſoeuer modeſtie a man pretend in ſuch a matter: neither would publike honeſtie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, to enlarge my ſelfe to rehearſe the faultes of mine eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, liking much better to burie ſome part of their greeuous enterpriſes vnder ſilence, than in publiſhing them (albeit in trueth) to caſt my ſelfe into daunger, to incurre the ſuſpition to be a ſlaunderer. Seeing than (my Lords) that in this Proſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the queſtion is not onely to taxe any perſon, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to make it a pray, but alſo it is knowen to euerie one, that by my woundes, they minde to wound the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth and the ſtate of all theſe countreis: as alſo this is no more now performed, by ſmall diffamatorie libelles, made by people of no account, and whoſe iniuries done againſt me, ſhould no more moue me, than the tounge of ſome litle ſerpent, which a man muſt rather breake in peeces with his foote, than inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to fight againſt it with weapons: but that men of ſo great cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, ſhould ſo farre and ſo vilely debaſe their greatnes, as to buſie them ſelues, faſlie to backbite and to ſlaunder, it hath ſeemed vnto me altogither neceſſarie to ſpeak, to the end
<pb facs="tcp:7223:8"/>that our common countrie (for which I am readie to giue vp my lyfe, as I haue alreadie loſt my goods) may not feele her ſelf damnified or hurt by my ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; that on the other ſide, theſe famous titles, of ſo many Countries &amp; Kingdomes, ſtretching them ſelues ſo farre as ouer Africa and Aſia, may not daſell the eyes of many, who iudge the affaires &amp; matters of this world, rather by ſhadowes, appearaunces, and outward ſhewes, than by ſtrength and ſoundnes of reaſon. I knowe notwithſtanding all this, that thoſe which perſecute me, haue in many pointes aduantage againſt me, and principally in two pointes: the one is, that they make a ſhewe and boaſting, of their great qualities and eſtates, which do infinitely exceede my condition: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which is alſo a naturall thing to al men) willingly to open their eares to euil ſpeaches &amp; ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders: for I haue oftentimes heard, the moſt elegant of all the Poets, to haue very well ſaid, that there is not in any feaſt any ſawce ſo ſweete, to the pallet of the mouth, as euill ſpeache and backbyting is to the eare: and on the other ſide, that nothing is hearde ſo much againſt the heart, and with ſo great griefe, as the ſpeache of him that prayſeth him ſelfe. Of theſe two pointes, that which bringeth pleaſure is giuen to myne enimie, and I haue for my ſhare, that which is harde and vupleaſaunt almoſt to the whole worlde. But I hope, that by the meane of your fauour and vſuall good will, that neither the one nor the other, ſhall bring me any loſſe or hurt, ſeeing that ſo it is, that this long time ſithence you haue tried, that theſe great and famous States, if they be ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and tainted with tyrannie, can not gaine much of free heartes and noble courages. And on the other ſide, knowing the ordinarie trade and courſe of my life, who loue not more to blame an other man, than to prayſe my ſelfe, yet if it ſo fall out that I do, either the one or the other, as it is a very harde thing not to do ſo (albeit that it ſhal be with the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie that I can) and if there be any thing that may ſeeme not very ſeemely, it ſhalbe long to you (my Lordes) to attribute the ſame, rather to the neceſsitie ſo to do (which mine enemies haue layde vpon me) than to my nature, &amp; by that meanes to vnburthen me, and to laye the faulte wholly, vpon their owne
<pb facs="tcp:7223:8"/>ſhameleſnes &amp; importunitie. And I wil praye you (my Lords) to remember, that I am falſly accuſed to be <hi>vnthankefull, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, an heretike, an hypocrite, like vnto Iudas and Cain, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturber of the countrey, rebellious, a ſtraunger, an enimie of mankind, the publike plague of the christian common wealth, a traytour, and a wicked perſon, that I am ſet out to be ſlaine as a beast, with rewarde to all murtherers, and to all poyſoners which will attempt the ſame,</hi> leauing you to iudge (my Lordes) whether it be poſsible to purge my ſelfe from ſuch ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, without ripping vp in ſome matters, the ordinarie courſe of my life, &amp; without exceeding my cuſtome, in ſpeaking of my ſelfe and other men. In the meane whyle, I am ſo aſſured of the iuſtice of my cauſe, and of my ſoundnes and faithfulnes towardes you, and on the other ſide, of your equitie and roundnes, and of the knowledge that you haue, howe &amp; after what ſorte all things haue paſſed, that I demaunde no other thing of you, but onely that you would iudge, and take notice of this matter, and determine thereof for your owne good, health, and preſeruation, that which the lawes, freedomes, liberties, and priuiledges of the countrey, commaunde you, according to the hope that thé people hath of your wiſdome and vprightnes: which thing alſo I pray you to do, yea I earneſtly beſeeche you, by all holy &amp; ſacred things, and that by the othe and band which you beare to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, certainly aſſuring my ſelfe, that as in many other matters I am leſſe than mine enemies, ſo that I ſhalbe in this behalfe ſo much the more their ſuperiour, as that by all meanes &amp; craftes they haue purpoſed, to violate, breake, &amp; ſuppreſſe your lawes, your priuiledges, and liberties: whereas on the other ſide, I haue with a good heart and all faithfulnes, imployed my ſelfe to maintaine &amp; preſerue the ſame. And albeit (my Lords) that I am not in ſuch ſorte an enemie, to my renowne &amp; owne good name, but that I take delight and pleaſure (as alſo I hope my actions and deedes deſerue the ſame) to be in good accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t among all the Princes, Potentates, and common weales of the world (excepting onely amongeſt the Spaniards &amp; their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who perſeuering in the purſuit of their tyrannie, I deſire not either grace or fauor, or any free<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhip at their handes) not
<pb facs="tcp:7223:9"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, ſeeing that you are the men only in this matter, to whom I haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an othe, to whom alone I cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t my ſelf bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d who alone alſo haue power to approue or improue my actes &amp; deedes: I ſhall hold my ſelfe very well ſatisfied, when on your parte I ſhall haue receaued a teſtimonie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable &amp; agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my intentes and purpoſes, which haue alwayes bin ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with your good, profit, and ſeruice: and I ſhall patiently ſuffer other people and nations, to iudge thereof according to their paſsions and affections, or rather (which thing alſo I more deſire) according to equitie, right, &amp; iuſtice, hauing firſt put of all preiudice, and freed their own vnderſtandings from the thick cloudes of theſe greatneſſes and glorie, which might heretofore haue ſomewhat dazeled them.</p>
            <p>Nowe if mine enemies (my Lordes) had come directly, to the point and matter of the Proſcription, ſetting out the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, vpon which is grounded, this barbarous ſentence (which ſentence in deede doth ouermuch declare their minde verie baſe and much degenerating from the vertue and courage of their aunceſtors) I had not vſed likewiſe any circuites or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsinges of wordes, but had at the verie entrie declared, both what myne owne innocencie is, and howe weake and ruinous their foundations and groundworkes are. But ſeeing that to make me odious, they haue better liked, to ſet, euen at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce, before the eyes of all the worlde, a heape of iniuries, and in the courſe of this ſpeache, without purpoſe to interlace them, ſpeaking ſo ſhameleſſely of me: I ſuppoſe, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, yea in deed moſt iuſt, that I aunſwere to ſuch ſlaunders, to the ende that ſome being mooued or perſwaded by ſuch words, may not yet receiue this my defence, with a harte more eſtraunged from me, than the lawe allowed amongeſt people, and iuſtice it ſelfe requireth.</p>
            <p>As concerning then this heape of iniuries, by which I am ſo ſhameleſly rent in peeces, and which being taken out of this Proſcription, nothing ſhall remaine therein but a ſmoke: you ſee (my Lordes) howe plaine and without painting coulours the defence is that I vſe. If you knome me to be ſuch a one, as myne enemies publiſhe me to be: if I carrie either in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb facs="tcp:7223:9"/>or in my ſoule, ſuch coulours as the forger of this writing ſaith, that he hath painted me out withall (for my Lordes ye haue knowne me from my youth, and I haue not ſpent my age els where, but with you) ſhut immediatly your eares, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to heare or vnderſtande, ſo much as one worde comming out of my mouth. But if on the other ſide, I haue all my lyfe thorowe, bin more honeſt, more ſounde, more continent, and leſſe couetous, than the authors of this ſlaunderous writing, and then he, which hath publiſhed the ſame, to witt, the Prince of Parma and his predeceſſors, whoſe factes are ouerwell knowne by hiſtories: if I ſaie, you haue knowne me and mine aunceſtors, more vertuous people than theſe (for I ſpeake not as yet of the King) and their aunceſtors, then beleeue, that as they falſely ſlaunder at the verie entrance, ſo they ſhal be no more meete to be beleeued, in all the reſt of their ſhameleſſe accuſations. For, to what ende I pray you, ſerueth this recitall of ſo many iniuries, but onely to ſhewe vnto the worlde, that my enemies are ſkilfull to ſlaunder and backbite, and that he, whom yet thorowe Gods goodnes, they haue not bin able to murther, neither by poyſon, nor ſword, nor yet to deceaue by promiſes, nor yet buſie him with vaine and vncertaine hopes, they do aſſay at the leaſt to wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him, with the venim of their tongue, accuſtomed euen from their youth to ſo infamous an occupation?</p>

But that ſhall be with this condition alſo, that if I declare, that there is no Prince in the worlde, more vngratefull and vnkind towardes a poore Lorde, than he that accuſed me and would condemne me, is againſt me and mine: that the vnfaithfulnes alſo which he hath vſed in reſpect of me (for I wil not yet ſpeak of the ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> violating of his faith towards the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie) is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that then (I ſay) he alſo may be ſubiect to the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and ſtate, and may be holden for ſuch a one as he is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt all liuing people, and all poſteritie to come: and I ſhall thinke the puniſhment more great in his behalfe, than he thinketh any in myne, as may appeare by that, which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſhewe to ſeeke for by this tragical Proſcription, the which thorowe Gods grace and goodnes, doeth no more aſtoniſhe me than a vaine viſion or dreame. Firſt (my Lords) I proteſt, that the remembraunce and memorie of the Emperour Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, ſhall alwayes be in an honorable account with me, as well becauſe of his actes, as that it pleaſed him, to ſhew me ſo much honor, as to haue nouriſhed me in his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, by the ſpace of nine yeeres, to whom alſo I yeelded &amp; performed, moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and moſt willing ſeruice. But if he, who by reaſon is moſt bounde of all men to maintaine his renowne, come to accuſe me of ingratitude and vnthankfulnes, as, that I haue not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the good turnes, which he ſaieth, that I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued of the Emperour: I beſeeche you to holde me excuſed,

            <p>Nowe then he ſaith, that in reſpect of the ſucceſsion of the late Lord, the Prince Rene my coſen,<note place="margin">An aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver to the accuſation of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> the Emperour handled me fauourably. But wherein? Firſt, there was neuer any Lorde as yet founde ſo euil aduiſed, that would pretend right againſt me for ſucceſsion in ſo much that if the Emperour hath not hindered me in that, what hath he done for me, that a iudge, the greateſt enemie I could haue, would not haue done like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? Was there yet anie partie founde ſo raſhe, that durſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him ſelf to ſpeak againſt it? And though I had had aduerſe parties, if my right were ſo cleare and ſo well grounded, that nothing was euer yet hetherto able to be alleadged againſt it, which was able to darcken it, or to ſhake it: and that herevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Emperour had giuen forth a decree for my profitt, what hath he done for me, but adminiſtred me iuſtice, and would not take from me that, which the lawes, reaſon, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie nature it ſelfe did giue me? But if it pleaſe you (my Lords) to conſider the nature and qualitie of this ſucceſsion, you ſhall finde my right and title to haue bin ſuch, that the Emperour could not haue depriued me of it, or taken it from me, without an extreame iniurie, and a moſt manifeſt wrong.</p>
            <p>There were in the ſucceſsion, two principall members or braunches: The firſte was,<note place="margin">The ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau &amp; Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</note> that which came by our houſe of Naſſau, which my Lordes my predeceſſors, the graundfather and great graundfathers, vncles by the fathers ſide, and coſen germaine by the fathers ſide, enioyed: that is to ſaye, the goods which at this day belong vnto me, in Brabant, Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Hollande and Luxenburgh: the other was, the ſucceſsion of the houſe of Challon. As concerning the ſucceſsion of Naſſau, which men commonly call Breda, becauſe it was the principall place of my Lordſhippes, and where I and my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours had helde our chambers of accountes, counſell, &amp; principall inſtructions pertayning to vs and ours, who was he

But ſo farre of is it, that I was hindered in that ſucceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by my ſaid Lord and father, that he him ſelfe tooke paines to come &amp; ſollicite the matter, that I might be put in poſſeſsion thereof: neither was there euer founde man ſo ſhameleſſe, that would ſet him ſelfe againſt it, but Schoore the Preſident or iudge, who in the counſell ſaide, that the ſonne of an heretike ought not to ſucceede, becauſe that my Lorde my father, following the examples of good Kings, as of Dauid, Ioſias &amp; others, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed the Churches of his countries, which he helde &amp; had in Germanie, and had purged them from abuſes, according to the worde of God, and that by the permiſsion and ſufferaunce of the Emperour. And notwithſtanding all this, the counſell ceaſſeth not to giue aduiſe, &amp; to determine the matter accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reaſon and equitie, as in deede it could not otherwiſe do, ſeeing that they had mainteined my Lord the Countie of Kingſtain myne vncle in the ſucceſsion of the Countie of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheforte, although that he him ſelfe were a proteſtaunt.

            <p>As concerning the houſe of Challon, firſt it cannot be ſaide in reſpect of the Barronies which I peaceablie holde and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe in the Dutchie of Burgundie,<note place="margin">The Barro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie &amp; of Daulphine.</note> and in Daulphine of Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, that I am therefore bound to the Emperor, for he had not anie more power therein than I, all being vnder the power of the Frenche King, who alike ſeaſed, the Countie of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollois, apparteyning to the Emperour, and my Barronries, when warre was mooued betweene them two, in ſo much that I can not be otherwiſe bounde vnto him therefore, but in this, that I was conteyned in the treatie of peace made at Seſſons, which was the laſt duetie that he could yeelde, to the

And there is no Prince, in reſpect of my ſaide Princedome, whoſe amitie and good grace I ſtande in neede of, but of the French Kings, who I hope will not touche that, that belongeth to a poore Prince, who is his moſt humble ſeruaunt, becauſe reaſon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not that, beyonde which reaſon he will not go, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe of the loyall and faithfull ſeruices, that my prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours haue done to the Crowne of Fraunce, and the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of Brytannie (whereof he is deſcended and is the heire) with great daungers of their liues, great expenſes, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite trauailes.</p>
            <p>There remayneth then that which belongeth vnto me, in the Countie of Burgundie, and whereof, I haue bin ſo long time, ſo vniuſtlie and tyrannouſlie ſpoyled and diſpoſſeſſed, which by meanes of lone and borrowing, yeeldeth vnto me, euen to this preſent time, two millions at the leaſt of loſſe But I would in the firſt place, that they ſhould remember, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Countie of Burgundie, is called Franck or free, to wit, amongeſt other reaſons,<note place="margin">Poſſeſsions in the Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ck or fre cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie</note> becauſe that the freedome and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Lordes, and ſuch as holde poſſeſsions in the ſayde countrey, is, that they haue power, by will to bequeath and to diſpoſe of their goods, howe and to whom, they ſhall thinke good, without being either for their wiues or their children, or other heires whatſoeuer inforced, otherwyſe to diſpoſe of their goodes, but in ſuch ſorte, as ſhall be agreeable to their owne will and pleaſure. Seeing then that ſo it is, that my Lorde the Prince Rene, mooued of his owne good will, did (without anie other reſpect that he had to me, who was at that tyme a yonnge childe li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:7223:13"/>and he hauing no other reſpect but that I was his couſin ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine) did, I ſay, appoint me his generall heire, which thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he did, according to the power that he had, euen by the lawes and cuſtomes of the countrey: I ſaie that if I ought to yeelde thankes to any, it is to the memorie of the ſaide Lorde Prince, who being the eldeſt of our houſe, ment alſo, that as I ſhould ſucceede him in the order of age, ſo I ſhould come in like ſorte to ſucceede him in his goodes and poſſeſsions. I perceaue not then as yet, euen to this preſent time, that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing at all bounde for this ſucceſsion, to the houſe of Spaine, neither is there anie man in the worlde, that can ſaie it with ttueth.</p>
            <p>But the Emperour gaue a graunt vnto the ſaid Lord Prince, by will to bequeath it,<note place="margin">The graunt</note> to whom he ſhould thinke good: and by the power of that graunt the Prince choſe me for his heire. This (my Lordes) maketh very much for me, and can at no hand ſerue myne enemies turne. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperour yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the graunt, he knewe not who ſhould be nominated heire by the Prince, neither was it knowen of any man, vntill the day of the opening of the will, which was done in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Marie the Queene, after the death of the ſaide Lorde Prince: in ſo much that the Emperour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſenting to the grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſeeing that his purpoſe was not to aduaunce me, I doo not thinke my felſe to be bounde vnto him, becauſe the fauour which was ſhewed vnto the Prince (which notwithſtanding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie meane perſon whatſoeuer, may eaſely obteine, by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie letters out of the Chauncerie) was not ſhewed on my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, or in reſpect of me. Beſides, to iudge of the graunt, by that which afterwardes inſued therevpon, ſhould be to iudge againſt the rules, which ſo oftentimes I haue heard the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour repeate, who ſaid, that Counſelles ought to be examined, liked or diſliked, by the cauſes and not by the effectes. But let vs put the caſe, that he had not had the graunt, yet nothing was appointed by the will of my Lord the Prince Rene, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawes, as hath bin before ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Teſtament militarie.</note>But what will they aunſwere, when beſides all theſe reaſons, I ſhall ſaie vnto them, that the teſtament or will of my Lorde
<pb facs="tcp:7223:13"/>my coſen is a militarie teſtament (which thing alſo they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not gaine ſaye nor darken) yea, and that made, with very great ſolemnitie, rype iudgement, and in good ſeaſon: made I ſay, &amp; grounded, by expreſſe termes and wordes, vppon this, that the ſaide Lord Prince (who had before felt, what were the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of warre, in ſo many expeditions taken in hande for the Emperours ſeruice) was nowe on the way, to go to a warre ſo daungerous, and that with ſo great a Prince as King Frauncis was. And though I be not a great Doctor in the lawes, yet ſo it is, that I do verie well remember, that I haue hearde ſundrie learned perſons diſputing of this matter, in the preſence of my Lord my father, who affirmed, that not onely militarie te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamentes or willes, but alſo little ſcrippes or ſcrolles, to be of ſuch value &amp; force, according to the lawes of the Empire, that if a man of warre, or a ſouldier, had before his death made or giuen the leaſt marke of his will, yea the leaſt ſigne that a man can imagine or thinke of: as if he had but traced or drawen with his blood vpon his targett, his name whom he will inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, ordaine, and appoint, to be his heire: or with the print of his halbert or of his ſworde, had writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that that decree of his laſt will, is inuiolable, and to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before al other ordinaunce, according to the auncient pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges of thoſe, which are honored with the warlike chaine or coller. Howe much more then was this priuiledge, dew to ſo valiaunt a Prince, &amp; to ſo noble a Knight? For the queſtion is not here, of ſome one ſimple marke or other, but here is a teſtament or will well &amp; aduiſedly made, and that not in haſte or by a ſimple ſouldier wounded, and being readie to die, but by a vertuous Prince, and one worthie of immortall honor, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by his counſell, and ſomewhat forward in his waie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the expedition, and the thinges bequeathed not to a ſtraunger, but to his couſin germaine, and not to an importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate flatterer, but to a young childe being verie farre of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperours armie, which went to beſeidge Saint Diſier, &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to do the ſame euen to Paris. But here is an ordinaunce I ſaie, made not without the knowledge of the Emperour, but by his owne graunt, yea an ordinaunce according to the lawes
<pb facs="tcp:7223:14"/>and cuſtomes vſed in all places. This then being ſo ſtrong, it was not in mans power to reaſon againſt it, and much leſſe to make it voide, vnleſſe by ſome one waie or other, which ſhould haue bin ouer tyrannons, and which (it may be) might haue brought more hurt than profit, to the renowne and credit of the Emperour, ſpecially if he had ment to offer any other thing than reaſon. And as there haue bin amongeſt my prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors ſome, who haue in deede founde meanes and wayes, to cauſe vniuſt and vngrateful perſons, who kept their goods and poſſeſsions from them, to yeelde them the ſame: ſo I hope, that God will yet ſhewe me this grace, to haue a bleſſed iſſue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, who hath vniuſtly ſpoyled me of my goodes, and would barbarouſly take from me my life alſo. But ſeeing that I am inforced, yet to ſpeake of the ſucceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I would faine haue ſome tel me, whether the Emperour ſuffering me to enioye the ſucceſsion, hath giuen it me of his owne or no: for if I haue receaued nothing from him, but that which before appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to my Lord the Prince Rene, I perceaue not how the King can in any manner vpbraide me, that either he, or the Emperor his father, haue giuen me any thing, vnleſſe this be liberalitie, to giue largely of an other mans goods.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, albeit that at this preſent time, I ſaye nothing of the wronges that haue bin done me in the ſay de Countie, in which I haue ſuch rights and preheminences, and whereof they haue ſpoiled me, and whereof I ſpeake nothing at this time, leauing to debate and reaſon thereof, till armes &amp; weapons ſhall haue yeelded me more reaſon, than the iniuſtice of him that keepeth all from me: this I muſt needes ſpeake, I had no ſooner taken holde of the ſucceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And this is the heape of iniuſtice that they charge me with if I haue done any. The Emperour was requeſted by my Lord my father, that at the leaſt I might, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawes, be firſt reſtored vnto the poſſeſsion, in which my predeceſſor had bin, but he would not ſuffer it: only
<pb facs="tcp:7223:14"/>he ſuffered me (being nothwithſtanding ſpoyled) to followe my right by iuſtice and lawe, wherein he left me at the leaſt, ſome gapp, becauſe he did not let me, from debating my right againſt him, when the cauſe was called forth to the parliament of Malines. But the ſonne (who notwithſtanding dare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braide me with his good turnes) ſeeing the cauſe readie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue iudgement, the very ſelfeſame day that the proceſſe and controuerſie ſhould haue bin cleared, &amp; the aduiſe of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and Counſellours was alreadie regiſtred, and I had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſſement giuen me, to ſeeke and prouide for ſiluer for the Iudges fees: he I ſay, forbad his courte to proceede any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and left the proceſſe hanging vppon the hooke or file, where it remayneth yet to this preſent. You ſee (my Lordes) that iuſtice was well miniſtred by him which had ſworne the ſame to me, and to the Barons of this countrey. And theſe be the great aduauntages and profits, that I haue receaued from the houſe of Spaine: this is the foundation and groundworke of al their reproches: and vpon this is this infamous frame or building of Proſcription, ſtayed and ſetled.</p>
            <p>But if on the other ſide, I ſhould come largely to laye out, howe much the houſe of Spaine is bounde to my predeceſſors (for concerning my ſelfe I will as yet ſay nothing) I am afraide to enter into ſo great a ſea, which I can not paſſe ouer in many monethes, wherefore I will touche onely the principall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, leauing vnto you my Lordes and to the readers, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſearching and finding out of the ſaide boundes, in the hiſtories and auncient recordes of this countrey.</p>
            <p>He that of the houſe of Auſtriche, firſte came into the lowe countreis, and that a long time after that my predeceſſours helde therein, both Counties and Baronneis, was the Emperor Maximilian, then Archduke of Auſtriche.

<pb facs="tcp:7223:15"/>had broken the rancke and order, by meanes whereof, the great conqueſt of King Lewis the eleuenth was ſtayed and let, which thing dyd afterwardes, aſſure Maximilians ſtate and condition? Was it not he, which vpon his returne out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out of Fraunce, founde Maximilian wonderfully troubled in Flaunders, againſt my Lorde of Raueſtain, and thoſe of Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, who alſo preuayled ſo much by armes and by counſel, that a truce and concluſion was made, who was once againe the cauſe, to vpholde and mainteyne the ſaide Archduke, and who in like ſorte cauſed the accorde made with the inhabitaunts of Bruges, to be mainteyned, whereof euen yet at this day, there do remaine notable markes and tokens, both of his fidelitie, and of the thankefulnes of the inhabitaunts of Bruges? It is the verie ſame Engelbert, that ſubdued thoſe that rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, about the borders of the Rhine, and eſtabliſhed the ſaide Emperour quiet in his countreis of Oultremeuze: that I may ſpeake no more of the daungerous voyages attempted for the ſaide Emperor, as that voyage into Brytan for the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of mariage betweene the ſaide Lorde Archduke, &amp; the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Anne heire of the Dutchie, and afterwardes twiſe Queene of Fraunce, which matter he ſo well followed, that all was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed and further proceeding ſhould haue bin made therein, ſauing that my Lord Iohn.

            <p>No man can denie, that in his time there was anie Lorde in all theſe countreis, who laboured more in the ſeruice of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Charles, than he. And to the ende, I be not ouerlong in reciting that which is ſo well knowne, I will onely in a worde tell you, that it was he, that put the imperiall crowne vpon the Emperours heade, hauing ſo earneſtly followed this matter, euen then, when the Emperour, in reſpect of his young age, &amp; by reaſon of his abſence (for he was in Spaine) was not able to purſue the ſame, that he perſwaded the Princes Electours to preferre the Emperour before the Frenche King, who ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtlie laboured to obteyne the ſaide election. And as euerie one knoweth, that this imperial crowne was the bridge, which afterwardes made a paſſage to the Emperor, to obtaine ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie conqueſtes: ſo none can denie, but that the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, ought to be giuen to the ſaide Lorde Countie. But can anie man ſhewe me at this preſent, ſo much as one marke or note of recompence, or one onely good turne that our ſtocke hath receaued from the houſe of Spaine? Men may ſee in ſundrie places of theſe countreis, peeces of ordinaunce, with the armes of Hungarie vppon them, which the King of Hungarie gaue to my predeceſſors, in teſtimonie and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of that their vertue and ſtrength, which they had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed and ſhewed in their ſeruice againſt the Turkes, certaine of which peeces were violently taken from me, &amp; caried away by the Duke of Alua, out of my houſe of Breda, when he play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tyrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this countrey, and yet ſome of them remaine there to this day. Which thing I put downe to declare, that ſo long as theſe peeces ſhall laſt, ſo long alſo ſhall the notes and markes of my aunceſtours vertue indure, &amp; there ſhall remaine alſo, a notable teſtimonie which the King of Hungarie hath giuen them. But, as my predeceſſours haue bin ſo noble, and by the grace of God, &amp; the good gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their things, were neuer yet poore: ſo they neuer yet demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded any thing of the Princes of theſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis, neither yet receaued any thing as of free gift, and yet I am ſure, that the imperial Crowne at the leaſt, deſerued ſome one recompence or other. I confeſſe that the ſucceſsion of Challon, and of the Princedome of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,
<pb facs="tcp:7223:16"/>was a great increaſe vnto our houſe, but if we be bound to any for that, truly it is to the great King Frauncis, who gaue in mariage to the Lord myne vncle, the ſiſter of my Lorde the Prince Phillibert, the daughter of my Lorde the Prince Iohn, who was nouriſhed and brought vp with Quene Anne, the Grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dmother of the ſaid Lord King, &amp; whoſe Couſin the ſaid Princes was. And thus you here ſee (my Lordes) the honeſtie and good behauiour of this Monarche of Fraunce. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour got and receaued his crowne by the paines and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nayles of my vncle: Frauncis the King (who knew all, that the ſaide Lord had done, for his Competitor, that is, for him that ſought to be Emperour as well as he) ceaſed not for all that, to giue him this Princeſſe in mariage, who was not the ſuppoſed heire only, but the verie heire in deede of my Lorde the Prince Philibert, the ſaide King confeſsing, that he ought not to be diſpleaſed with him, who had conſtantly followed that parte which he tooke vpon him to followe: In ſo much that I may ſay of him, as the Hiſtoriographers of his time ſaid, that it was an aſſured teſtimonie of a noble and liberall hart in the Prince. And albeit, the Emperor had graunted ſome thing, to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of my Lord the Prince Rhene,<note place="margin">The Prince Rhene.</note> &amp; that (according to the laſt appointement) he had graunted ſome extraordinarie pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge and benefit vnto his will: ſhould this I beſeech you be a ſufficient recompence, yeelded to ſo faithful and ſo excellent ſeruices as he had perfourmed, who was ſo valiaunt and ſo cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious a Prince, &amp; had done for him ſo many duties, hauing by force of armes, not onely recouered for the Emperour the damage of a battaile loſt, but alſo hauing againe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered for him the Dutchie of Gelderlande, and in fine he him ſelfe yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp his ſpirite at the Emperours feete, and that for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice?.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I neede to ſpeake of Prince Philibert, who alone obtayned for him Lombardie, and the Kingdome of Naples, and with my Lord the Duke of Burbo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, aſſured him of the ſtate of Rome, and tooke the Pope for him as a priſoner: and to be ſhorte, hath giuen him a heape of all excellencie and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? And yet nowe his ſonne will come, reproching the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce
<pb facs="tcp:7223:16"/>of ſuch Princes, and will ſaie, that the Emperour hath executed iuſtice to their ſucceſſor and couſin. Nowe if they of Naſſan had not liued heretofore: if they of Ora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, had not done ſo many deedes of armes, before that the King was borne, he would not haue put ſo many titles in the beginning of this Proſcription, by which he doth falſlie &amp; ſlaunderouſlie pronounce me a trayterous and wicked perſone, which as yet neuer hath fallen out, and I hope neuer ſhall fall out in anie of my race. But let them aunſwere me, by whoſe commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Cardinall of Graundvelle, impoiſoned the laſt Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian the Emperor, whileſt he was the King of the Romans, I knowe what he tolde me concerning that matter, and that afterwardes he was ſo afraide of the King and the Spaniardes, that he was altogether fearefull, to make profeſsion of that religion, which he knewe notwithſtanding to be the beſt.</p>
            <p>He proceedeth and ſaieth, <hi>that he hath as it were in order of ſucceſſion,</hi>

               <hi>continued and increaſed more and more my ſtate and countenaunce, hauing made me of his order, afterwardes Lieutenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t generall in the gouernement of Hollande, Zeelande, Virecht, and Burgundie, of his counſell of Estate, and that he hath bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon me ſundrie good turnes and honours.</hi> As concerning bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, I can not at any hande confeſſe it, vnleſſe a man will call the great expences that I haue bin at, as well for the ſeruice of the Emperour, as of the King, benefites. For they which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at that time, and ſpeciallie in the Kinges time, may wel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, howe the Court alwayes was greatlie accompanied, with the nobilitie of ſundrie and diuers nations, and for the moſt parte, with the nobilitie of Germanie. Nowe, euery one knoweth, that my houſe laye alwayes open, and that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie I was to make the diſcharge and defraying of all char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, bearing the expences of the Court, with a verie little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowaunce and order, that was made on the Kinges behalfe. Euerie one knoweth alſo, the great and exceſsiue expences, that I was of neceſsitie to bee at in the voyage, in whiche both agaynſt my will, and likewiſe againſt ſundrie prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations made to the Emperour, and alſo to the Queene of Hungarie, I was conſtrayned, to carrie the Crowne of the
<pb facs="tcp:7223:17"/>Empire to Ferdinando the Emperour, and herevnto I was the more vnwilling, becauſe it ſeemed not reaſonable vnto me, that I ſhould carrie from my Maiſters head the crowne, which in times paſt had bin ſett therevpon by my predeceſſors. After this, I made the voyage into Fraunce, wherein I was ſent for one of the pledges, appointed for the eſtabliſhement and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the peace made at Chaſteau in Cambreſis, whiche brought vnto me alſo great expences and extreame charge, in ſo much that I can in theſe three pointes (vnto which adde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the charges that I was at, in the laſt warres, &amp; ſpecially thoſe at the towne Philippe and Charlemont, where I was generall) verely aſſure you, that I ſpent more than fifteene hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande Floreins, and yet notwithſtanding, the Chamber of account or Exchequor, may eaſely aſſure men of this, that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had ſo much as one farthing, in recompence for theſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices: yea that being Lieutenaunt generall of the armie, I did not receaue for all charges, but three hundred Florins a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, which was not ſufficient to pay the ſernaunts that pitcht my tentes: yea alſo if the Queene of Hungarie were yet aliue, ſhe could wel remember, that which ſhe ſpake vnto me, when the Emperour (perceauing him ſelfe to be in the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie that euer he was, partly by the power of Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and of William the Lantzgraue, and partly by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Frenche King) made the peace of Paſſau,<note place="margin">The peace of Paſſau.</note> with as great loſſe to our hou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe, which ſerued him with our great loſſe and charges, to preſerue the Empire for him, as it had before obteyned the ſame for him. For, albeit in an open aſſemblie of the Empire, the Emperour, being by the aduiſe of the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours ſet in his throne and Imperiall ſeate, had iudged, &amp; that by a definitiue ſentence, that we ſhould haue the Countie or Earledome of Catzenellenboghen, with more than twoo millions of Florins for arrerage, he made notwithſtanding his peace with our loſſe, putting, by the agreement of Paſſau, our aduerſe parties in the poſſeſsion thereof without any recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence giuen to vs. Which thing I propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de not at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to ſtirre vp againe anie contention, ſeeing that our houſe hath ſince that time, agreed, with the moſt famous houſe of
<pb facs="tcp:7223:17"/>the Lantzgraues of Heſſen, whoſe good kinſemen and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes we are: but to the end we may make the whole world to vnderſtand, the great benefits that we haue receaued, from the houſe of Spaine, and that euerie one may knowe, who it is that by good right is to be taxed for ingratitude and vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And this (my Lordes) is not the like firſte parte that they haue ſhewed vs. For my Lorde the Prince Rhene, being at that tyme the eldeſt of our houſe, purſuing ſo courageouſly the warre of Cleue lande, the Emperour promiſed him, that he would neuer conclude peace, with the Duke of Cleue lande,<note place="margin">Peace made vvith my Lorde the Duke of Cleue.</note> but vpon condition, that he ſhould leaue vnto vs peaceablie, the thirde parte of the Dutchie of Iuilliers, which appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto vs, by the ſucceſsion of my Lorde, the Countie Iohn of Naſſau my great vncle, and Margaret the Counteſſe of Iuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers and of Marck: notwithſtanding, perceauing him ſelfe to be the Conquerour, he made peace with him as pleaſed him, forgetting that this victorie, was obteyned to his handes, by the trauayle and valiauntneſſe, of my ſaid Lorde and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</note>As concerning the honours, which he ſaieth he hath done me, I will neuer denie, as I haue ſaide heretofore, but that the Emperour did greatlie honour me, whileſt he nouriſhed me &amp; made me of his Chamber, by the ſpace of nine yeeres, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes in my two firſt warres, hauing appointed me &amp; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me charge ouer all his ordinaunce, in theſe countreis. And albeit, that I was not then one and twentie yeeres olde, yea though I were abſent from the Court, at my Lordſhip of Bueren, notwithſtanding (the Duke of Sauoie attempting a voyage) the Emperour him ſelfe choſe me for generall of the armie, albeit that the Lordes of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel,<note place="margin">My lord the princemade generall of the armie at the age of 21 yeeres.</note> yea &amp; the Queene hir ſelfe, did preſent thereto ſundrie other perſons, whoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie and vnderſtanding was verie great, as my Lordes the Counties of Bouſſu, of Lalaing, Martin van Roſſem, olde Knights and Souldiers, and the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ties of Arenbergh, of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghem, and of Egmont, who was twelue yeeres elder than I. All this notwithſtanding, albeit that no man named me, (as afterwardes they affirmed to the Emperour) by reaſon of my
<pb facs="tcp:7223:18"/>youth, yet ſo it was, that it pleaſed the Emperour to chuſe me, for the reaſons which then he declared, &amp; which the Queene of Hungarie, inforcing me to take the charge vpon me, cauſed me afterwardes to vnderſtande, which alſo I like better for this preſent time to conceale, than to declare, leaſt I might ſeeme, ouermuch to prayſe, priſe, and eſteeme my ſelfe. I ſaye yet more, that it pleaſed the Emperour (my Lordes) then to cauſe me to come from the campe, when he declared vnto you, the will and purpoſe that he had to put ouer his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, into the handes of his ſonne the King, and it pleaſed him yet further ſo much to honor me, that he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme this ſolempne act in my abſence, yea he preſented him ſelfe amongeſt you in your aſſemblie, leaning vpon me by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his infirmitie, which thing ſundrie at that time thought was a verie great honour vnto me. But be it ſo, that ſince that time, the King had beſtowed vpon me ſome honours, yet I cannot ſee, howe after anie ſorte he can preuayle or get anie thing thereby, ſeeing that contrarie to all right and reaſon, yea contrarie to his owne othe, he hath gone about to take them from me.</p>
            <p>As concerning the order, if the Emperour and the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or companie of the Knightes thereof, haue giuen me their voyce, I am no more bounde to him therefore, than to other Knightes, ſeeing it was neceſſarie for him to allowe of that, which the Colledge approued, euen as he him ſelfe kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that we, in the laſt aſſemblie of the order, helde in theſe countreis, did, by pluralitie of voyces, without his aduiſe, and againſt his will, chuſe ſundrie Knightes of the order, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them ſo to be receaued and accepted. But be it, that I were indebted to him therefore, yet ſo farre of is it, that he may reproche or vpbraide me therewith, that on the other ſide, he him ſelfe is to be therefore greatly charged.<note place="margin">The priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the order.</note> He hath ſworne, and it is alſo contayned in the pointes that concerne the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the Knightes of the order, ſhould be iudged by their brethren, that is, them of the ſame order. Verely, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the power of Duke Philipp ſurnamed the Good, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force my Lorde Iohn of Luxenbourg, to forſake the othe
<pb facs="tcp:7223:18"/>which he had made, to the King of Englande, the ſaid Lorde of Luxenbourgh, committing the determination of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in controuerſie betweene them, to the Colledge &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the Knightes of the orders. But the brethren, which the King hath appointed to my Lordes, the Counties of Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount and of Hornes, to the Marques of Bergues &amp; of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignie, for their triall, were porters, petiefoggers, and people of no account, by which alſo he hath cauſed me to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, againſt all order and courſe of law, euen as I haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proteſted, and haue alleadged the inſufficiencies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the preſence of all Europe. In ſo much, that hee him ſelfe hauing done againſt his owne othe, and againſt the orders and articles of the Colledge or companie, he is at no hande to be hearde, in ſuch reproches as theſe are, wherein there are founde the ingraued markes, of his owne othe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violated and broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And beſide, if I ought to yeeld thanks to anie of the order, for the gouernementes and other digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that I haue, it muſt be to the Emperour, whoſe minde it was, &amp; who had ſo decreed the ſame, before he would depart out of this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, hauing before known the duties that I had performed, &amp; my faithfulnes, namely in reſpect of my ſeruices yeelded, in the gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; guiding of his armie, wherein I haue for witnes, my Lord of Neuers, and the late my Lorde of Chaſtillo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Admiral of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, who in deed made vs afterwards to know, that he was our aduerſe partie: all which notwitſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they gained nothing (thankes be to God) vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, but I builded in deſpite of their beards, the town Philippe, &amp; Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, albeit that the plague, did very ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly afflict our armie.</p>
            <p>As concerning the gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Burgu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>die, I can certainly aſſure al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that I haue not receiued any thing,<note place="margin">The gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of Burgundie.</note> but that which my predeceſſours haue at all times mainteyned, as appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto them by inheritau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and in deede my Ladie Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert of Luxenbourg (my Lorde the Prince Philibert hir ſonne being in Italie) cauſed the Eſtates of Burgundie to aſſemble and meet, in the Town of Nozeroy. And becauſe that ſome thought it not meete and couenient, becauſe my ſayd towne was vpon one of the Frontiers of the Countie of Burgundie,
<pb facs="tcp:7223:19"/>ſhe aunſwered, that ſhe ment to mainteine the poſſeſsion, of the Lordes of the houſe of Challon, who were by inheritaunce Gouernours of the Countie of Burgundie. But be it whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be, the behauiours of the King towardes me do ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare, that he can not obiect vnto me theſe honours, which againſt all rules of honor, he goeth about to take from me, together with my life and goodes, hauing by violence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from me mine owne Sonne, againſt all lawe, either of God or man, yea againſt the priuiledges of the countrie, which he ſware to obſerue at his glad entraunce into it.</p>
            <p>As concerning the chardge and office of Counſellour of Eſtate,<note place="margin">Counſellor of the eſtate</note> I haue ſufficiently inough declared in my defence made heretofore, in the yeere ſixtie ſeuen, that the Cardinall and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers practiſed this matter, that I might be called thereto, thinking thereby to cloake and couer them ſelues, onely with my authoritie before the people, and therefore I ought not to thinke my ſelf bounde vnto them for this, becauſe, that in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this they ſought not ſo much myne aduauntage, as their owne profit. But if they be deceaued of their hope, they muſt attribute it, either to their owne want of capacitie, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able wiſely inough to order and direct their enterpriſes, or els (which in deede is more true, for they dyd not want witt &amp; vnderſtanding) that their wickedneſſe was growen ſo great, ſo apparaunt, and ſo palpable, that no man was able to indure them, but that they were caſt out of the countrey, as a venime or poyſon, yea as a publicke plague.</p>
            <p>Nowe, for as much as they haue not onely directed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt my perſon,<note place="margin">Of the laſt mariage of the ſaide Lord Prince</note> accuſing me of vnthankefulnes and vnfaithfulnes, but euen as rage and madnes doth equallie byte the whole worlde, as wel the innocent as he, whom men iudge culpable: ſo their petulancie, and diſorder hath bin ſo great, as that they haue deſired, to touche &amp; taint the honour of my wife, by the blame which they ſuppoſe to laye vppon my laſt mariage: I knowe not, whether I may iudge them more to be condemned in impudeucie, or in beaſtlines, whileſt that theſe ſkilfull men, who boaſt them ſelues to be ſo good painters, knowe not as yet to practiſe that leſſon, which is ſo often ſaide
<pb facs="tcp:7223:19"/>and repeated, by the meaneſt ſchollers that be, that is, that he that prepareth him ſelfe to ſpeake euill of an other man, ought to be exempted from all crime and faulte. For this argueth great impudencie and raſheneſſe, if men knowe their notable faultes, and yet will notwithſtanding paſſe ouer their owne thornes and thiſſels, as if they were roſes: or if they knowe them not, what beaſtlines &amp; blockiſhnes doth this argue, not to perceaue and ſee that, which euerie houre of a daye offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it ſelfe, to their eyes and ſight? They ſee euery day before them an inceſtuous king, which is one onely halfe degree, nigh vnto Iupiter, the huſbande of Iuno, his owne ſiſter, &amp; yet they dare reproch me, with a holy, an honeſt, and a lawfull mariage, made according to Gods worde, and celebrated according to the ordinaunces of the Church of God. And againe I am here inforced to beſeeche you (my Lordes) not to thinke of me that, which as yet you haue neuer ſeene in me, to witt, that by their wicked ſpeaches, I am moued, to laie open theſe abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable biles, and to ſett before the eyes of al the worlde, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummednes and hardnes of ſuch conſciences, as theſe men carrie, but rather that it would pleaſe you to impute it, to this rage and deſperate madnes of the enemies of God, of the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of all Chriſtendome, and your enemies particularly, who are inflamed &amp; ſet on fire againſt me, for no other reaſon, but for this, that they knowe, the great care, diligence, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, that I haue had for your preſeruation. He then, that hath maried his Neice, dare reproche vnto me my mariage, a mariage I ſaye, verie lawfull and according to Gods order. He I ſay, dare vpbraied me with my mariage, who (to the end he might obtaine ſuch a mariage) hath cruelly murthered his owne wife, the daughter and ſiſter of the kings of Fraunce (as I vnderſtande they haue in Fraunce,<note place="margin">The mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Queene of Spaine.</note> informations and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions concerning that matter) yea his lawfull wyfe, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of two daughters, the true heires of Spaine, as I doubt not, but that the Crowne of Fraunce (the whiche heretofore hath giuen the Crowne of Caſtille, to a baſtard of whom Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip is deſcended, diſpoſſeſsing a tyraunt thereof, though he were lawfully borne thereto) ſhal haue no leſſe power, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
<pb facs="tcp:7223:20"/>and keepe it for the true heires, if God which is a iuſt Iudge, and neuer ſuffereth ſuch wickedneſſes vnpuniſhed, doo not take vengeaunce of it in his life time, depriuing him of his eſtate, which thing he hath moſt rightly deſerued, although he had not committed anie other faulte but this inceſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſo abhominable a murther. But you wil ſay, he had a diſpenſation for it. From whom? From the Pope of Rome, which is a god in earth. Verely I beleeue that, for the God of heauen would neuer haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented thereto. But what was the groundworke and foundation of this earthly, heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? For ſoth this, that he muſt not leaue ſo good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a kingdome without an heire: and marke wherefore there was added, to the former horrible faultes, a moſt cruell mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the father vnnaturally murthering his owne childe and heire,<note place="margin">The mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Prince of Spaine.</note> to the ende that by that meanes, the Pope might haue a gapp open, to giue a diſpenſation, for ſo execrable an inceſt, abhominable to God and men. If therefore we ſaye, that we do reiecte the gouernement of ſuch an inceſtuous king, the ſlayer of his ſonne, and the murtherer of his wife, who can iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie accuſe vs therefore? Howe many Kinges haue there bin, which haue bin baniſhed and driuen out of their kingdomes, which had not committed ſuch horrible crimes? For as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Don Charles his ſonne, was he not to be in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, our Lord and Maiſter? And though the father could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge againſt his ſonne a iuſt cauſe of death, did not this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter belong vnto vs, who had ſo great intereſt therin, rather to iudge thereof, than to three or foure Friers and Inquiſitors of Spaine? But it may be, that he made conſcience to leaue him for his heire, whom he knewe to be borne in vnlawfull mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, becauſe that at the time, that he ſeemed to marie the daughter of Portugale, the mother of Don Charles, he was maried to the Ladie Iſabella Oſorius,<note place="margin">The mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the K. of ſpaine vvith the La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>die Iſabel Oſorius.</note> by whom alſo he had two or three children, whereof the firſt was named Don Pedro, and the ſeconde ſonne was named Don Bernardino: of which mariage Rigomes the Prince of Yuoli, if he were liuing, could giue a good and ſufficient teſtimonie, for he
<pb facs="tcp:7223:20"/>was the procurer thereof, whereby alſo he obtayned that great credite, and ſo much goodes in Spaine, the which they do at this preſent, vnkindlie ſucke and drawe from his wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, as it were with a ſponge. Nowe, if he haue ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued him ſelfe, in that ſuppoſed mariage, that mariage alſo which he hath made with the daughter of Fraunce, hath not as yet bin more happie. For beſide the murther of the Queene his wife, it was alſo made noble, by an adulterie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling all other adulteries, that is, that he kept ordinarie and common houſholde, with the Ladie Eufraſia,<note place="margin">The adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vvith the Ladie Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraſia.</note> who being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come great with childe by him, he inforced the Prince of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coli to marie hir, and at the ende of a certayne tyme, the poore Prince (as the miniſters of the Kinges tyrannie ſaye) died for griefe, becauſe, that hauing to ſtrong an enemie, he was not able to remedie this, but that an other mans baſtarde ſhoulde be his heire. But they that ſpeake more certainlie of this matter, affirme, that he receaued a morſell more eaſie to ſwallowe downe, than to digeſt. And yet he, who is decked with a crowne of three ſuch mariages, being I ſaye, him ſelfe three tymes ſuch a huſbande, dare vpbraide and reproch me with my mariage.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe that he were not ſo defiled, and that we might cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him for a guiltles perſon, yet for all that I feare him not, as though he were able to reproche me with any faulte, and thankes be to God, I haue not done any thing, but verie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedlie, and that by the counſell of ſundrie honourable, wiſe, and diſcreet perſons. Neither is it needfull, that he ſhould tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle much in that matter, wherein he hath no intereſt, but to beholde and ſee, and of which alſo I am not bounde, to yeeld him any account or reaſon. For as concerning my wife that dead is, ſhe was alied to Princes of verie great credit, to wyſe &amp; honourable Princes, who I doubt not, but that they are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſatisfied in that behalf, &amp; if I would enter further into that diſcourſe, I could eaſely make it to appeare vnto him, that the moſt ſkilful of his doctors co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne the ſame. As concerning the mariage, by which I am alied at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, albeit that thei
<pb facs="tcp:7223:21"/>the ſonne of the ſaide Countie Ottho, maried the Ladie of Leck and of Breda, from whom alſo, I am in the right male line deſcended, and that in the fifth degree. May I therefore by any good right, be called a ſtraunger? And that I may ſaye nothing at this preſent time, of the goodes which I haue in Burgundie, where I haue (thankes be to God) a verie good portion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>haie I iuſtly be counted a ſtraunger? And I leaue it to you (my Lordes) to iudge, who knowe better our lawes, than anie people of the worlde, howe our Aunceſtors haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, time out of minde, and whether the Lordes of Raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain, or Luxenbourg, and of Saint Paule, of Neuers, of Eſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, and other Lordes, holding Counties and Baronneis in this countrey, were accounted for ſtraungers, and whether yet at this day, you account not as naturalles of the countrey all thoſe, which poſſeſſe ſuch Lordſhippes, ſo that they wil take part with theſe countreis: and haue we not for that in deede an expreſſe lawe amongeſt vs, as well in Brabant as in other places? For, as concerning the title of the Duke of Brabant, Countie of Flaunders and others, which he beareth and brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth of, albeit I confeſſe theſe dignities to be great, yet not withſtanding, if he and his Spaniards knowe it not, they muſt learne this, that the Barons of Brabant, with the good townes and cities of the Countrey, haue in deede (when the Dukes of Brabant haue ſo farre forgotten them ſelues, that they haue paſſed the boundes of reaſon) verie well taught them, what was the power of the Barons, and generally of the Eſtates of the countrie of Brabant. Nowe it is manifeſt, that I am deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from ſuch Lordes, as for ſundrie ages together, haue poſſeſſed the principal Baronneis and Lordſhippes of Brabant, Flaunders, Hollande, and Luxenbourg. But I hope, that my Lordes the Eſtates, haue ſo well begunne to declare vnto him, howe much he hath fayled in his dutie: and alſo that the ſaide Lordes will hereafter take him forth ſo good a leſſon, that the poore people of Sicilia, Calabria, Lombardie, Arragon, and Caſtille, will learne by our example, that this tyraunt ought not to be ſuffered on the earth: yea that the poore people of Granata them ſelues, will knowe, howe they ought to handle
<pb facs="tcp:7223:21"/>ſuch a tyraunt, who in the time of the warre with the Moores, cauſed to be impriſoned, about an hundred marchauntes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitauntes of Granata, all of them being Chriſtians, of which the leaſt was worth, fiftie thouſande Ducates, and afterwardes, by a hurlie burly amongſt the people, cauſed them to be ſlaine, putting into his coffers all the goodes of thoſe poore people. And to be ſhort, my Lordes the Eſtates (God ayding them) wil teache them, how ſuch muſt be handled, that will falſifie their othes made and giuen to ſo good a people, at their ioyfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce.</p>
            <p>But (my Lordes) if I come to proceede further, and ſhould beginne largely to laye out before you, the long time paſt, in which my predeceſſours, had not onely their beginning here, but were alſo Lordes, and poſſeſſed great goodes, titles, and dignities in theſe countries, I might ſaie vnto you, that at the time that his predeceſſours, were Counties of Habſbourg, &amp; remained in Switſerlande, myne were long time before Lordes of the Countrey of Gelderlande, whereof yet at this preſent, there are remaining the armes of our houſe of Naſſau, for the armes of the Duke of Gelderland, and we haue not (as it were) paſſing by it, kept the ſaide countrey in poſſeſsion, but, after that my Lorde the Countie Ottho, had maried the daughter and heire of the Voght or Regent of Gelderlande (for ſo did men name at thoſe dayes the Lordes of Gelderlande) which continued from the yere 1039. vntill the yeere 1350. my predeceſſours were the Lordes, Counties, and Dukes of the Countrie of Ghelderlande,<note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau, vvere the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ties &amp; Dukes of Gelderland fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the yere 1039. to the yeere 1350.</note> as yet euen to this day men maye beholde the monumentes and markes thereof.

I will not (my Lordes) recite vnto you anie thing of that, which I haue ſeene in the Emperours time, not becauſe I did not perceaue ſundrie matters ſet out &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the Spaniardes,<note place="margin">The natural diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards vvas al vvais cruel, but yet kept vnder for a time, by the vviſdom of Charles the Einperour.</note> which I approued not as good, and of which I did not ſufficiently conceaue, that the diſeaſe in proceſſe of time, might growe ſo farre, that in the ende it ſhould be verie neceſſarie to vſe, a ſtrong and powerfull medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and to purge the countrey, from theſe pernitious and hurtfull Spaniſhe humours. But becauſe I was not able then, by reaſon of myne age and the little experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I had, to knowe the deepe malice of the Spaniardes and their adherentes, I could hardlie perſwade my ſelfe, that we ſhould be inforced to bring, a whot yron to this cancker of Spaine, or els to come ſo farre, as to roote it out. But after that, together with my age, I began to be of a more ſetled and ſounde iudgement, I had in
<pb facs="tcp:7223:22"/>in deede a contrarie opinion, and deliuered the ſame to ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie others, which neuer knewe to thinke, that the rage and crueltie of the Spaniardes, could proceede ſo farre: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fell out, by which I might haue verie particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of their cruell, couetous, and proude naturall diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but I certainely and aſſuredly looked for the ſame long time before. I will therefore let paſſe that time, which cometh not alſo at anie hande to be compared, in any manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie with that, which hath ſince fallen out in the time of the king his ſonne, not that the Spaniardes were then better, than they are at this preſent: for, amongſt the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and in other places, where they commaunded abſolutely, they yeelded to euident a proofe, of their peruerſe, naturall diſpoſition, and tyrannous affection and will. But their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pride, was in ſome ſorte reſtrained, by the good affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Emperour bare to the ſubiectes of this countrey: &amp; becauſe alſo, that theſe prouinces were full of braue Lords, wiſe and valiaunt men, ſauoring of their auncient nobilitie, (and would to God they had children like vnto them) whiche ſerued in ſteede of a bridle againſt their inſolencie, and of a countermure againſt their pride &amp; raſhnes.

            <p>The Emperour of moſt noble memorie, and the Queene Marie, ſeeing their affaires and buſineſſes ſo impaired by the meanes of a cleane contrarie iſſue, of the warres of Germanie (which fell out otherwiſe then the Pope &amp; the Spaniardes had promiſed to them ſelues) whileſt that the Frenche king, was ioyned in league, with ſome of the chiefe Princes of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelf of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Lordships, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth them to his ſonne.</note> his Maieſtie I ſaie, was inforced to agree with his enemie, his affaires ſtanding in ſuch condition, that deſpairing of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie to keepe his owne countreis, he purpoſed to withdrawe him ſelfe into Spaine, and there to lead a priuate life, after that he had veelded vp all his kingdomes, Landes, and Lordſhips, and had laide them vpon the perſon of his ſonne. And albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it,
<pb facs="tcp:7223:23"/>that the King, becauſe of the condition of his owne eſtate, had neede to vpholde his ſubiectes, in good will and affection towardes him, (of which thing alſo he had moſt expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement from his father) ſeeing, that of the meanes and valure that they had, there did wholie depende, the ſauegard of the countrey, and the maintenaunce of his owne honour: yet, whether it were by reaſon of the nouriſhement whiche he had in Spaine, or by the counſell of thoſe, which then did, and euen to this time haue poſſeſſed him, I knowe not, he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies foſtered in his hearte, a minde to make you ſubiect, to a certaine ſimple and abſolute bondage, which they call, a ful and whole obedience, depriuing you altogether, of your aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient priuiledges and liberties, that they may diſpoſe of yon, your wiues, and your children, and handle you, as his officers haue done the poore Indians, or at the leaſt as they do, the people of Calabria, Sicilia, Naples, and Millaine, whileſt they remember not, that theſe countreis, are not countreis atchei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by conqueſt, but come for the moſt parte by they way of patrimonie, or els ſuch as willingly gaue vp them ſelues vnto his predeceſſours, vnder good and lawfull conditions. But it is likely that he did it by the aduiſe of ſuch, as ſerued the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour his father, and the King his great vncle, in ſteede of a foundation, the better to reare vp, the building of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Lordſhippes, to which we ſee, the houſe of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriche hath atteined, it being at this day, without all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, the greateſt, &amp; the mightieſt of all Chriſtendome.

But in the middeſt of his great affaires (ſo diſorderous &amp; vnruly was the deſire he had to plaie the tyrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) he gaue forth
<pb facs="tcp:7223:23"/>a moſt plaine &amp; moſt certaine demonſtration of his euill will. The Emperor, who (my Lords) knew better, then any Prince or man of the world, the arrogant and proude nature of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes, and it may be alſo, the inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the King his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne,<note place="margin">The Empes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors counſel giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the King his ſonne.</note> and on the other ſide, the ſtate of this countrey, &amp; whatſoeuer might deſtroy &amp; preſerue it, did ſeriouſly aduertiſe his ſonne, that if he kept his pride of Spaine, he ſhould diligently foreſee, that he were not the cauſe, of the vtter ruine and deſtruction of this eſtate, which could not long ſuffer &amp; endure, this ſame proude gouernement, which the Spaniardes exerciſe in euery place where they can. And he gaue him this exhortation, in the preſence of the late my Lord the Countie of Boſſu, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of him that laſt deceaſſed, and in my preſence alſo, and in the preſence of ſundrie other Lordes of his chamber, of which ſome are yet at this day liuing. But neither the authoritie and commaundement of his father, nor the profit of his owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, nor iuſtice, nor his othe, (whiche yet notwithſtanding doth keepe in the moſt barbarous nations) were able in anie thing, to moderate and reſtraine, the naturall diſpoſition and affection that he had, to tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niſe ouer vs, but on the other ſide, as though he had bin aboue all lawes, priuiledges, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the countrey, yea and aboue equitie and iuſtice it ſelfe, he hath broken all bondes, that he might outrage in all maner of vnreconcilable hatred and crueltie.</p>

            <p>And if it be lawefull for me to ſpeake anie thing of my ſelfe, if hee haue but one droppe or ſparke of gratitude and kindeneſſe in him, hee can not denie, but that I was one
<pb facs="tcp:7223:24"/>of the principall inſtrumentes and meanes, to cauſe him to come to ſo excellent, and to ſo profitable a peace, hauing pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately treated thereof, with my Lordes the Conſtable, Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moranci, and the Mariſhall of Saint Andrewe, at the inſtant requeſt of the King, who aſſured me, that the greateſt ſeruice that I could performe vnto him in this worlde, was to make a peace, and that he purpoſed to haue it whatſoeuer it coſt him, becauſe he ment to go into Spaine. But ſo farre of was it, that eyther he or his counſell, conſiſting of Spaniardes, and of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other perſons of this countrey (who alwayes continued in hatred againſt you, your libertie and the whole lande) did take in good parte, either this ſo good an aide, or the happie execution that inſued thereof, that on the other ſide, they iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this ſuccour and aide, to be a fault of hie treaſon againſt his Maieſtie, and for the which you (and aboue all other, the late my Lorde of Lalaing) had incurred, by good right, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of puniſhment.<note place="margin">The late L. of Lalaigne and all the Eſtates ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to death by the Spaniardes.</note> And why ſo? Becauſe you (my Lordes) would not agree to anie thing, without the aſſemblie of the Eſtates generall, and becauſe you ment, to cutt the talents of theſe harpies and Rauenours of Barlemontes, and ſuch like, when you decreed, that the money ſhould be diſtributed by your commiſsioners, according to the conditions propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto them. Beholde in deede two great faultes, the one for ſoth was, to demaunde a meeting and an aſſemblie of the Eſtates. For in aſmuch, as it ſerueth for a bridle and a barre vnto tyrannie, it is a crime, ſo much the more hated of tyrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (who are the deuourers of the people, and enemies of their ſubiectes, and of their owne crowne) as this noble aſſemblie, is loued, honoured, and reuerenced, of true Kinges, true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſuch as are the good fathers of the people, becauſe it is in deede the true foundation of an Eſtate, the aſſuraunce of the common wealth, and the onely peace &amp; quietnes of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The other fault will neuer be pardoned, for theſe byters of the people, liuing with the blood of poore people, haue ſo long time made account of their theeueries and ſackings, that they ſuppoſe their ſpoyles, to be as good, and as an aſſured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewe (yet much more frutfull) as their fieldes and gardens,
<pb facs="tcp:7223:24"/>and diſſembling the true cauſe of the miſchiefe, whiche they hide from their Princes, they ſeeke pretextes and cloakes in flattering of them, and in lying vnto them, to harden and to ſet on fire, their heartes againſt their ſubiectes. I haue ſeene (my Lordes) their doings, I haue hearde their wordes, I haue bin a witnes of their aduiſe, by which they adiudged all you to death, making no more account of you, than of beaſtes, if they had had power to haue murthered you, as they do in the Indies, where they haue miſerablie put to death, more than twentie millions of people, and haue made deſolate &amp; waſte, thirtie tymes as much lande in quantitie and greatnes, as the lowe countrie is, with ſuch horrible exceſſes and ryottes, that all the barbarouſneſſes, cruelties, and tyrannies, whiche haue euer bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, are but ſport, in reſpect of that, which hath fallen out vpon the poore Indians, which thing, euen by their owne Biſhoppes and Doctours, hath bin left in writing, and, to make the King without excuſe before God and men, the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thereof was dedicated vnto him, by one of his owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, in whom there remained, as it ſhould ſeeme, ſome ſmal ſparke of iuſtice. From that time then (my Lordes) I, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lordes, and ſundrie of the beſt &amp; wiſeſt perſonages, both of the nobilitie, and of the common people, thought it good, to cauſe (if we could) the Spaniards to departe out of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, thinking in deede, that, albeit there were yet remayning ſome corrupt blood amongeſt vs, as verely we ſee, ther is more remayning then were meet, which did proceede, from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected race, of the contagion of the fathers, who ſerued at that time, the ambition of the Spaniardes, and followed the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls buſineſſes, yet notwithſtanding, that the better number, and all the Lordes of the greateſt credit and countenaunce, would be enemies to this Spaniſhe tyrannie. But, partly tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe other buſineſſes, and partly, by reaſon of my voyage, &amp; the going of ſome other Lordes into Fraunce, whether we were ſent for hoſtages, as alſo to be preſent at the Frenche Kinges daughters mariage, the buſineſſe it ſelſe was interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the perfourmance thereof hindered. Nowe ſo farre of is it (my Lordes) that I will denie a great part of that, which
<pb facs="tcp:7223:25"/>is ſet out againſt me, that I account it on the other ſide, a great prayſe for me, and will (it may ſo fall out) tell you more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, than mine enemies knowe, and the more that they ſhall write againſt me, and giue a teſtimonie of their furie and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uions harte againſt this countrey, the more wil I reioyce here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that it hath pleaſed God, to ſhewe me this grace, to be an ayder to cutt of the courſe, of this vnmeaſurable tyrannie, and by that meanes alſo, to haue bin an aſsiſtaunt, to the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation and opening, of the true Religion.</p>
            <p>They ſay, <hi>that from the time, that the King turned his foote, from theſe lowe countreis, I haue, by ſiniſter practiſes, ſleightes and ſubul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, aſſayed to gett the good willes of the Malcontentes, and of ſuch perſons, as haue bin greatlie indebted, haters of Iuſtice, deſirous of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties, and specially of thoſe that were ſuspected to be of the religio.</hi> As concerning them that had the knowledge of the religion, I confeſſe,<note place="margin">The loue that the L.

For, ſeeing that from the cradell, I was nouriſhed therein, and that my Lord my father, had liued and died therein, hauing driuen out of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippes the abuſes of the church: who is he, that will thinke it ſtraunge, that, if this doctrine were after ſuch ſorte ingrauen in my heart, and had taken ſuch deepe roote therein, it ſhould come in good time, to bring forth hir fruites? For, ſeeing that I was ſo long time brought vp, in the Emperors chamber, and being of the age to beare armes, I was euen then preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapped, with great charges in armies: for theſe reaſons I ſay (and conſidering the ſcarcitie of good education that we had in reſpect of religion) it was no marueile, though I had then in my head, the feates of Chiualrie, hunting, and other exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g noble men vſe, rather than thoſe things, which concerned my ſaluation. And yet notwithſtanding I confeſſe, that I haue great occaſion to prayſe God, that he hath not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, this holie ſeede to be choked, which he him ſelfe hath ſowen in me, and I ſaye moreouer, that I neuer liked, of theſe cruell executions, of fier, of ſword, of drownings, &amp;c. whiche were at that time verie common, againſt thoſe of the religion, as the ſcriuener or painter (for ſo he nameth him ſelfe) of this infamous Proſcription, calleth them.

I confeſſe, that I was at that time, in ſuch ſorte mooued with pitie and compaſsion, towardes ſo many good people, as were appointed to ſlaughter, &amp; generally towardes this whole countrey, to which I was ſo much bounde, &amp; into which they ment to bring in an Inquiſition worſe &amp; more cruel, than that of Spaine, yea that there were nets laid, to catch, euen the very noble men and the Lords of the countrey, as wel as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people, inſomuch that they whom the Spaniards and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herentes, were not able to ſupplant by any other way, might fall by this meanes into their hands, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to eſcape, becauſe, that a man could behold nothing els, but a very laberinth, whereby they might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to the fire: I, ſeing I ſay theſe things, do confeſſe, that from that time forwarde, I did earneſtly attempt to helpe to driue out of the countrey, this vermin of the Spaniards, &amp; I do not repent me, that I haue done it, but iudge rather, that I, and my Lords my
<pb facs="tcp:7223:26"/>companions, which fauoured this ſo laudable an enterpriſe, haue done a deede worthie of immortall prayſe,<note place="margin">The enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of the Lordes, to cauſe the Spaniardes to departe out of the countrey.</note> and which in deede had bin altogether acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed, and we by that meanes had atchieued the vpheaped meaſure of honour, if, after their gripes, we had as well ſhut the gate againſt them, ſo that they might neuer after haue entred in againe vppon vs, as we haue ſince founde out and had the meanes to purge the Countrey of them. And I ſaye yet ſomewhat more vnto you (my Lords) and I wiſhe that the whole counſell of Spaine, yea that the whole worlde ſhould vnderſtande it, that if my brethren and companions of the order, and of the counſell of Eſtate, had liked rather to ioyne their counſelles with mine, then to make ſo good and cheape a market of their own lines, al of vs would haue imployed, our bodies and goodes, that we might haue hindered the Duke of Alua and the Spaniardes, from entring againe into the Countrey: and I am yet euen at this preſent content, that they ſhould vnderſtande, that, as alreadie one parte of the countrey, is ſcoured from this filth, inſomuch that there is not therein any remembraunce thereof, except it be of their bones: ſo I will not ceaſe, by the power of God, and by the aſsiſtaunce of your fauour, (which I hope will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer faile me,) to imploye all the power that I haue, with you (my Lordes) to purge the whole countrey in generall, from this vermine, and to cauſe them and all their adherentes, to paſſe from hence ouer the Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taignes, there to trouble their owne Countreis if they will, and to ſuffer vs to liue here, in peace and quiet poſſeſsion, of bodies, goodes, and conſcience. Wherefore they are deceaued verie much, when they thinke, that I attempted this worke, after their departure out of this countrey. For I did it then, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was in Fraunce, euen a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the King, whileſt they them ſelues were here, and I ceaſed not, till that by the meane, of the late Ladie of Sauoie, of moſt noble memorie, I had obtayned leaue, to come againe into this countrey, vpon my faith and promiſe giuen, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe to Reins, at the coronation of King Frauncis the ſeconde, and being come hither, I prouoked not bancke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>routes, but good and honourable people, and of the chiefe &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:7223:26"/>moſt noble perſonages of the countrey, in the name of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates to demaunde, that the Spaniardes might be inforced to with drawe them ſelues: which thing was at the laſt executed, and the enemies may remember (if they will) who were thoſe good, and honourable perſonages, that brought them that moſt vnpleaſaunt meſſage, who when they ſhall ſhewe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, the aduerſaries ſhall knowe and confeſſe, their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies and ſlaunders.</p>
            <p>But as concerning that which they ſaie, that I was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall authour of the ſupplication preſented and offered vp,<note place="margin">The requeſt preſented by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.</note> I will in deede tell you (my Lordes) the whole matter, that is, that hauing once perceaued, that the miſchiefe was growen ſo farre, that there was not nowe any more queſtion, of burning onely the poore people, which ſuffered them ſelues to be caſt into the fire, but, that ſundrie of the beſt nobilitie, and of the principall men among the people, murmured thereat: I fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome daungerous iſſue, as I had ſeene before mine eyes Fraunce it ſelfe to haue endured, a daungerous acceſſe of ciuil warre, for the like occaſion: and doubting leaſt we ſhould be aſſailed in this countrey with the like diſeaſe, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath moſt daungerous accidentes, and effectes, more harde to heale, than the diſeaſe it ſelfe, as alas we do ouer much ſee it at this daye: ſeeing I ſaye, theſe thinges, in reſpect of the bonde wherewith I was bounde by reaſon of my othe, and in reſpect of my dutie towardes the countrey, I beſought my Lordes my brethren, and companions, the Knightes &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Counſelloures of the Eſtate, to aſſemble together at Hoochſtraten, with purpoſe to declare vnto them, the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt daunger wherein the countrey was, to witte, of falling into ciuill warre, and that this was the true and onely meane to hinder it, that we, who by reaſon of our degrees and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, had authoritie in the Countrey, ſhould take the matter into our handes, and ſo to vſe that remedie, which we ſhoulde finde moſt agreeable, for the countreis good, and onely to bring to paſſe, that the Cardinalles creatures (who ſought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but effuſion of blood, banniſhmentes, confiſcation of goodes, and to be ſhorte, woundes and murthers) ſhould not
<pb facs="tcp:7223:27"/>deale therein, which had brought an aſſured deſtruction to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, but rather that thoſe which thought it not meet, that men ſhould burne others according to their accuſtomed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhould not want a guide, who might lett and hinder him in his attempts. And albeit, I ſhewed them very many reaſons, to cauſe them to condeſcende to my counſell, and that I had added thereto (beſide the good will which was betweene vs) the aduiſe alſo of my Lorde the Countie of Schwartzenbourg my brother in lawe, and the Lorde George van Hol, who had at that time verie great credit with the Lordes, for the euident and excellent ſeruices, whiche they had perfourmed to theſe countreis: yet it was not in my power to obtaine any thing, &amp; this mutuall ſight one of an other, did not profit me any whitt at all, ſauing for a teſtimonie to all the worlde, that then, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miſchiefe a farre of, which nowe we ſee preſent vppon vs, I did ſeeke all the good meanes I could, to preuent &amp; turne away the ſame. But they of whom I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who thought theſe perſecutions heard, and who ſawe not ſo long as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, any aſſured reſt in this countrey (which thing alwayes falleth out in ſuch like affaires) began and laboured to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde and broche newe enterpriſes, which, by reaſon of the offices I had, I founde out a meane to diſcouer: yet for all that, fearing leaſt ſome moſt daungerous euent might inſue therevpon, and ſuppoſing that this waie was the moſt milde, &amp; verie lawelike or lawfull, I confeſſe, that I thought it not euill, that the requeſt was preſented, which thing ſo farre of is it, that I minde to diſſemble, or coulor ouer, that I cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it a moſt great profit, both for myne owne honor and reputation, and alſo for the ſeruice of the King and the countrey, for if the wiſe Counſellors of the King, had bin ſo well aduiſed as to yeelde therevnto, there had not inſued ſo many miſeries, by whiche, there wanteth but a litle, but that the whole countrey had bin conſumed. But if they deſire to knowe, the true &amp; the nigheſt cauſe of the ſaide requeſt, and of that which followed therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, let them aſſcribe it to their inſatiable crueltie, which was not content, with the intollerable rigor of placardes and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences
<pb facs="tcp:7223:27"/>but following the example of that foole Roboam, and beleeuing the counſell of an vnwiſe woman, of a Cardinall the Popes creature, and other ſuch like, they ſaide, the father hath corrected you with roddes,<note place="margin">The Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Pare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, and the Cardinall Grandvelle, vvere the cauſe of all the miſchie fes in the lovve couns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis.</note> but the ſonne will chaſtiſe you with ſcorpions. Wherevpon there was ſet out, a moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt purſuite, concerning the receauing of the newe Biſhopps, (who were ſet vp but a litle while before) that is to ſay, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie tormentours, to burne the poore Chriſtians, then were the priuiledges troden vnder feete, and by whom? Verely by a paſsionate woman, who was yet notwithſtanding armed, with the viſar of a Kings power, and with the treaſon, periuries and ſubtelties of a Cardinall. Beholde I ſay, the ſtithie or andvile (my Lordes) vpon which was forged all the euill that inſued, to wit, becauſe they yeelded not, (as requiſite and neceſſarie it was) to the requeſt preſented by the nobilitie, wherin I know, and I may proteſt it, before God and before you (my Lordes) that I did not therein commit any thing againſt myne Honor, and mine othe, but I aduertiſed the Dutcheſſe, &amp; al the Lords of the Counſell, of the great inconueniences which afterwards fell out, inſomuch that all the, miſchief inſuing therevpon, muſt be imputed to them ſelues. For ſo farre of is it, that they would harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to me, that thei thought on the other ſide that they had founde, a matter or meane fit for to execute that, whiche they had a long time purpoſed and ſet before them, that is to ſaye, that after that they had deſtroied them, that were ſuſpected to be of the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they might afterwards the more eaſely bring the reſt, vnder a miſerable and intollerable bondage. And not only were they admoniſhed by me (my Lords) but alſo ſundry, publike, and particular admonitions were giuen them by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others, both good people and louers of the countrey, yea and louers of the King alſo more then he deſerued, and they did in good time aduertiſe him, of the daunger to come, and what was the Kinges dutie, by reaſon of his othe, of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations or bondes, and of the conditions vppon whiche he was receaued and admitted for Lorde of theſe Countreis, as alſo his aunceſtours were before him.</p>
            <p>My Lord the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie of Egmond him ſelf, was ſent into Spaine,
<pb facs="tcp:7223:28"/>to ſhewe the ſaid aduertiſements, vnto the Kings own perſon, which notwithſtanding ſo farre of was it that it could profite anie thing, that the ſaid Lord Countie on the other ſide being deceaued, vnder the coulor of the word of a King (which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes coſt him verie deare) brought letters altogether contrarie to that, which the King from his owne mouth, had giuen him in charge to ſpeake, in ſomuch that then he was in-forced to confeſſe, that I did before his iourney well foreſee, that which ſhould come thereof. And yet theſe ſchollers of Machiauell, would here bleare our eyes, with theſe goodlie ſhewes of loyaultie, fidelitie, naturall clemencie, and ſuch gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and glorious wordes, and yet notwithſtanding they make no difficultie, to playe with the othes which they take, &amp; with the wordes that they giue, to men of ſuch qualitie and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce. Beholde then, the authours, promotors, and framers of the troubles, that haue fallen out by reaſon of the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt or ſupplication, and you haue vnderſtoode (my Lordes) that this was the counſel that I haue giuen therein.</p>

If they would ſay theſe things were the cauſe, they ſhould ſpeake ſome peece of the trueth.

And if there haue neuer bin, any more cruell tyraunt, who hath more proudlie, and with leſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration violated, the priuiledges of the countrey, then Philipp him ſelfe, ſhall not he be much more vnworthie, to beare, &amp; to weare the Crowne of Caſtille, then Don Pedro? For, at the leaſt Don Pedro was not an ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous perſon, nor a ſlaier of his Sonne, nor a murtherer of his wife. And if ſome will ſaye, that this concerneth me no whit at all, I am content to come yet ſomewhat more nigh, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that I haue not purpoſed, to ſtaie my ſelfe vppon that, which I ſhall preſently ſpeake vnto you. But ſuppoſe, that I did take vp armes againſt him, and that he were ſimplie my ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, and that I were borne his ſubiect (which yet is not ſo, euen as he him ſelfe confeſſeth it) what ſhould I doo but that, which his predeceſſor had done,<note place="margin">Albert Duke of Auſtriche took armes againſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolfus of Naſſau the Emperour.</note> againſt the Emperour Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus of Naſſau, his Superior? Eurie one that knoweth neuer ſo little in the matters and affaires of Germanie, knoweth, how Albert the firſte Duke of Auſtriche, of that name and race (for before he bare the title, of the Countie of Habſbourg) armed him ſelfe againſt the ſaide Lorde Emperour my predeceſſour. And albeit, it was Gods will, that the ſaide Emperour ſhould die in the battell, yet I know, what the wiſeſt writers haue iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereof, albeit that Gerrard, then Biſhop of Maience, the principall authour of that conſpiracie, ment to colour &amp; darc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſame. And verely, if a man will ſomewhat more nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looke into the ſtorie, he ſhall finde, that this faction was ſet vp by Pope Boniface (of whom it is ſaide,<note place="margin">Pope Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the 8.</note> he entered into his Popedome as a Foxe, he raigned as a Lyon, &amp; died as a dogge) becauſe the Emperour would not acknowledge him for ſuch a one, as he ſaid he was, and therefore, he ſtirred vp againſt him Albert, who was alreadie much diſpleaſed againſt him, becauſe Adolfus was preferred before him, in the election to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, &amp; ſome Biſhoppes alſo, ouermuch addicted to the Pope, did ioyne them ſelues vnto him, and ayded him.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7223:31"/>
            <p>But who is he, that would willingly reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſo wicked a man, who in his Iubilie, cauſed to be caried before him, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a triumphe, two ſwordes, cauſing him, that caried one of them, to crie, O Chriſt beholde thy Vicar on earth, and the other, to ſay, O Peter, beholde thy ſucceſſour? And verely, hauing committed ſo wicked a feate againſt the Emperor, and hauing Albert at his commaundement, he was purpoſed, for the like conſideration, to do as much to the French King, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Philipp the faire, giuing his kingdome to the ſaide Albert, and cauſed him to be named King of the Romains and of the French men. But he founde the preeſtes of Fraunce, leſſe readie to ſerue him, and leſſe able to helpe him, and the whole kingdome ſtirred vp, by the learned Orations of Maſter Peter Coignieres, and a reſolute King who cauſed his foolehood (for ſo the King called him in his letters) to be taken at Anania, by one of the Lordes,<note place="margin">King Philip the faire, be ginneth his letter vvith theis words Sciat fatui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas veſtra, that is, let your follie or foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood know</note> and he the eldeſt of the noble houſe of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonnes, and by a gentleman of Languedoc, named Nogaret, who brought him to Rome, where alſo they put him to death, as he had moſt iuſtlie deſerued the ſame. But, as I haue ſaide, I will not ſtaye my ſelfe vpon theſe foundations, but minde to come to the mutuall bondes, which are betweene him and vs. Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> put the caſe, that al this, were neither ſo nor ſo. Doth not he verie wel know, that if he be Duke of Brabant, I, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my Baronneis, am one of the principal members of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant? Doth he not know wherein he is bound to me, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and companions, and the good townes of the countrey?

O if he thincke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, doth he ſo litle regard that which he hath promiſed to God and the countrey, and that vpon conditions tied to his Dukes hatt or garland? It is not needfull (my Lordes) that I ſhould here ſet out vnto you that, which he hath promiſed vs, before that we tooke any othe vnto him, for ſundrie amongeſt you know the ſame: But becauſe that others ſhall ſee, this my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I was very willing, to call to your remembraunce, the ſumme of his othe. You knowe (my Lordes) wherevnto he is bound, and that it is not in his diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to do whatſoeuer he
<pb facs="tcp:7223:31"/>liketh of, as he doth in the Indies, for he cannot here amongſt vs, by violence inforce, one of his ſubiectes onely,<note place="margin">The ſumme of the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Brabant.</note> to any thing whatſoeuer, vnleſſe that the cuſtome, of the benche of the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, where they dwell, permit the ſame. He may not, by anie ordinaunce or decree, alter or chaunge, after anie ſorte what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, the eſtate of the countrey. He muſt content him ſelfe, with his ordinarie and common reuenewes: he may not cauſe to be leuied, nor yet exact any impoſitions or taxes, without the good will, and expreſſe conſent of the countrey, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the priuiledges thereof: He can not bring ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into the Countrey, without the conſent thereof: He maie not touche nor deale with the decrying or imbaſing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, without the conſent of the Eſtates of the Countrey: He can not cauſe anie ſubiect to be apprehended, without infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation made, and knowledge firſt giuen, by the Magiſtrate of the place: Hauing anie for a priſoner, he cannot ſend him out of the Countrey. I beſeeche you (my Lordes) do you not ſee, hearing only this ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me rehearſed, if the Barons and Nobles of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, who by reaſon of the prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, &amp; the charge of the armies, do not oppoſe them ſelues, I ſay, not only when theſe articles are violated, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are tyrannouſly trode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder foote, &amp; when not one article, but all, &amp; that not once, but a thouſand thouſand times, are broken &amp; corrupted, not by the Duke onely, but by barbarous and ſauage people: Do you not ſee, I ſaye, that if the Nobles, according to their othe, and bonde, do not inforce the Duke, to yeelde equitie and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to the Countrey, that they them ſelues ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, of periurie, vnfaithfulneſſe, and rebellion againſt the Eſtates of the Countrey? And as concerning my ſelfe, I haue in deede a particular reaſon, and which toucheth me yet more nighe, that is, that contrarie vnto all the ſaide priuiledges, I was depriued of all my goodes, without obſeruing any forme or order of iuſtice therein. But that which fell out in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my Sonne, the Countie of Bueren, is ſo euident a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, of the enemies diſloyaultie and vnfaithfulnes, &amp; of the tranſgreſsion or breache of the priuiledges, that no man can, with any good reaſon doubt, why I haue taken vp armes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7223:32"/>
            <p>And in that, I was not able at the firſt time, to take faſt foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the countrey, which he vpbraideth me withall, what newe thing hath betithed vnto me,<note place="margin">The firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of the L.

Yea, euen vnto him him ſelſe, who hath ſo oftentimes entered, and that with ſo great and mightie armies, into Holland and Zealand, and yet, with a handfull of people, and by the ayde of my Lordes the Eſtates, of the ſaide prouinces, he hath bin ſhamefully driuen out of the ſaide countrey, and that great Captaine the Duke of Alua and his ſucceſſours, without hauing at this day, in the ſaid countreis, one foote of lande vnder his diſpoſition, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, as by your good ayde, I hope that ſhortly, he ſhall not haue any in all the reſt of the countrey. To be ſhort, by his othe he meaneth, that in the caſe of gaineſtanding him, we ſhould be no longer bounde vnto him, neyther yeelde him any ſeruice or obedience, as appeareth by the laſt article. If then I be not bounde vnto him: If I owe him not any more ſeruice or obedience, why is he ſo raſhe, as to ſaie, that I haue taken vp armes againſt my Lord? Certainly betweene al Lords and Vaſſailes, there is a mutuall bonde, and this ſaying of a certaine Senator to a Conſull, ſhalbe alwayes prayſed: If thou doeſt not account me for a Senator, I wil not account thee for a Conſull. But betweene Vaſſals there is verie great difference, ſome remayning without compariſon in farre greater libertie, than other ſome, as we are in Brabant, hauing ſuch large pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges and rightes, that we may freelie make &amp; giue, grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in our landes, ſo that, excepting the homage which we owe, we cannot haue any thing more than we haue. And amongeſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rightes and priuiledges we haue this, to ſtande our Dukes in that ſteede, that the Ephori at Sparta did their Kinges, that is to ſaie, to keepe the Kingdome ſure, in the power of a good Prince, and to cauſe him to yeelde equitie, which ſtood againſt his othe.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, that there is a condition annexed, that is, that we ſhalbe ſo long freed from our othe,<note place="margin">An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> till he haue amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the faulte. But what if he will neuer amende it? If after the Emperour Maximilian, and the Princes of the Empire en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb facs="tcp:7223:32"/>him, and make interceſsion for vs, that it woulde pleaſe him to vnburden the countrey: for a ful aunſwere, ſome would ſaie vnto them, that they ſhould meddle with their owne mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that the King knoweth wel inough, how to gouerne his ſubiectes: If, after infinite declarations, by the meſſage of verie noble Lordes of this countrey, we do requeſt him to do vs iuſtice, he proudly reiect our requeſtes, and put to death the ſaide Lordes, and ſuch as he can take, cauſeth them to paſſe thorowe the hangmens handes, and purſue the reſt, by all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie and cruell meanes: If he bring in vppon vs newe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, vtterly to deſtroye vs, ſhall we tarie alwayes looking for mercie, vntill ſuch time as the Spaniſhe crueltie, ſhall haue cut of from vs all hope of reſpite? But he will nowe amende the fault, and hath ſent meanes therefore, by the Lorde of Selles: alſo he hath diſallowed the Duke of Alua. We ſhall ſee al theſe thinges in their order. For the preſent I am contented to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that by good reaſon I haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp armes againſt him: Firſt, with the Eſtates of Hollande and Zealande, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes with you (my Lordes) that he is foreſworne againſt the whole countrey, and in reſpect of me,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> againſt the articles of the poinctes of the order, againſt the priuiledges of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, in taking away my Sonne, and carying him into Spaine, depriuing me of my goodes and dignities, hauing ſet me ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently free from myne othe towardes him, and declaring at this preſent, his verie baſe heart, and yet notwithſtanding ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous, publiſhing this cruell and barbarous Proſcription, as the heape of all iniuſtice and vnworthines.</p>
            <p>Nowe (my Lordes) ſith it hath pleaſed him, to ſtretch out his ſpeache vnto the times which followed, I minde verely to enter thereinto alſo, and that the more willingly, becauſe that I haue done nothing of that, whereof hereafter he accuſeth me: but firſt, by the aduiſe and conſent, of the Eſtates of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande and Zealande, and afterwardes by your conſent in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, ſo that if there haue bin anie faulte committed, it ought not to be imputed to me, but rather I ſhould be greatly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe I ſerued you ſo well &amp; faithfully. I will then come, to the accuſations that remaine, but it ſhalbe with this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:7223:33"/>(my Lordes) that I may, as heretofore I haue done, largely rehearſe, and plainly ſet out, that which he maliciouſlie omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, to the ende he might couer his wicked and cruell heart, and yet neuertheleſſe ceaſeth not, to cauſe it to be publiſhed, by certaine ſmall ſlaunderous libelles.</p>
            <p>I haue (my Lordes) obſerued, that all this accuſation, or ill ſpeache rather, which followeth afterwardes, is diuided into two partes: the one touching that, which was ioyned with the comming of the Duke of Alua, and which followed thervpon, and ſpecially concerning that, which after my comming into Hollande and Zealande, was executed, by my gouernement, &amp; my Lordes the Eſtates of the ſaide Countreis: The other, is that which hath fallen out, ſince that God opened your eyes, by the meane of the pride and outrages of the Spaniards, and that you publiſhed them, and their adherents, for rebelles and enemies to the countrey, that ſo you might at the laſt deliuer this poore countrey, from this accurſed raſe. Wherefore I will followe the ſelf ſame order. And firſt I render thankes to God, that euen by the verie ſilence of myne enemie, you (my Lords) do knowe, and I hope, that all the worlde ſhall knowe, that I was not ſo much as ſuſpected,<note place="margin">The Lorde Prince vvas not ſo much as ſuſpected by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to haue tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> treaſure.</note> to haue applied to mine owne profit, ſo much as one onely pennie, of the publick coyne: for though in other thinges, as you haue alreadie begunne to ſee, they haue not ſtuck at it, to ſett out falſe accuſations, and to charge me, with ouer manifeſt ſlaunders: ſeeing alſo, that they do not obiect vnto me, the leaſt ſuſpition of couetouſnes, they do ſufficiently thereby declare, not only, howe free I am from that faulte, but alſo, albeit they them ſelues be impudent, and in very deede my deadlie enemies, yet they durſt neuer obiect againſt me, this fault wherewith commonly, the Gouernours of Prouinces, are either wrongfully or rightly charged. But, I thanke God, I haue long time ago learned, that he which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth and commaundeth others, ought aboue all things to haue cleane handes, and euen voide if it may be of all ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was the cauſe, that euen from my youth, I vnburde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my ſelfe, of the charge of the treaſures, which was moſt gladlie receiued &amp; accepted of others. And albeit (my Lords)
<pb facs="tcp:7223:33"/>that it was at no hand needfull, that I ſhould make mention of theſe thinges, whileſt I ſpeake vnto you, who knowe, that I neuer had the handling of one onely pennie of the publike treaſure: and as concerning this, that it hath pleaſed you to appoint me ſo much, as well in reſpect of my Eſtate, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the extraordinarie charges of the warre, you knowe howe litle I haue receaued thereof: and of the meanes, which yet I haue, howe I haue therewithall mainteyned and vpheld, ſundrie great charges, ſince that I entred into your ſeruice: which I do notwithſtanding not impute, to the want of your good will towardes me, but to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of the time wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we liue. But ſith, that by the ſecret confeſsion of mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, I may haue ſuch an aduauntage, I minde not to paſſe it ouer vnder ſilence, to the ende I might cauſe, certaine ſmall Serpentes that are amongeſt vs, to vnderſtand, that they ought to be aſhamed, to haue ſpread abroad, either againſt their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or els thorowe a certaine extreame follie and madnes, that which the verie enemies: who haue conſpired againſt me and the countrey, haue as yet neuer bin ſo impudent, as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect againſt me: perceauing in deede, that in propounding ſuch a matter, the brightneſſe of the trueth, woulde diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the filthineſſe of their life.</p>
            <p>Seeing then, that they place me in ſo goodlie a field, as to declare not what I haue done, but what the Eſtates of Holland and Zealande haue done, by my ayde and ſeruice, I refuſe not, euen before you my Lordes, and before all the men in the worlde, to enter into account with them: but alſo, ſith that you are the chiefeſt Iudges, of that whiche is done in this Countrey, it is more than reaſonable, that you ſhould regard that, whiche they haue vniuſtly perfourmed, in all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prouinces, whileſt that my Lordes the Eſtates of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, Zealande, and I, did ſtande in ſteede of ſtaies and hinderaunces, vnto the courſe of their enterpriſes and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes.</p>
            <p>Firſt they ſaye, <hi>That I practiſed to returne, into Hollande and Zealande.</hi> Though it were ſo, what other thinge did I, but that whiche my duetie required? And if I dyd enter vppon
<pb facs="tcp:7223:34"/>ſo good a foundation,<note place="margin">The cauſes vvhich mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the lord Prince, to come into Holland.</note> as I haue heretofore laide out, into the Countrey with an armie, why ſhould I haue made anie ſtaye, to enter into that, which was of myne owne gouernement, &amp; whervnto I was more ſworne and bounde, and wherein I hold the chiefeſt degrees of Honour, amongeſt the Nobilitie? But ſo farre of was I, from attempting ſuch matters, that on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, I am readie to ſhewe the letters both of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Gouernours of the townes, and of the principall townes themſelues, by the which I was called, for the deliueraunce of the countrey, againſt the tyrannie of the Spaniardes, &amp; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Duke of Alua. And as concerning the promiſes that I made, at my entraunce thereinto, and namely that they ſaye, that I promiſed the ſaide Eſtates to mainteine them, if the Duke of Alua would preſſe them, with the tenth and twentith pennie, ſhall neuer be founde true, but this rather, that I came the ſeconde time, openly and in armes into the countrey, that I might deliuer it, from that tyrannie, whiche then oppreſſed them, not onely in reſpect of the tenth pennie, but, for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande other ſortes of more than barbarous crueltie, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, for the great ſlaughter, that the Duke of Alua the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made, of the poore inhabitauntes of the ſaid countreis. And as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that, that they ſaie, that the eccleſiaſtical Romaniſtes, were perſecuted by me and driuen from their goodes, and an other religion brought in, I neede my Lordes for this no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defence, but that which you your ſelues knowe thereof, to wit, that the whole chaunge, which inſued therevpon, was rather a worke of God, then of men. You knowe, howe often I haue bin accuſed, that I did ouer coldly ſet my ſelfe againſt the aduerſaries: that I did ſuffer them to much: and that I ſhould be the cauſe of the ruine of the countrey, becauſe I was ouer ſlowe to chaſe them away, and to roote them out. And, when the queſtion was, to ſende ſome of them packing, you knowe the duties that I perfourmed, to the ende that euerie one might liue in peace, and one of them with an other. But the Eſtates, which at the firſt, thought it fit and profitable, for the preſeruation of the countrey, that both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religion ſhould be tollerated: learned afterwards, by the
<pb facs="tcp:7223:34"/>inſolencies, attemptes, and treaſons, of the enemies whiche were mingled amongeſt vs, that their Eſtate was in daunger, of an vnavoydeable ruine, vnleſſe they hindered the exerciſe of the Romane religion: and they perceaued, that thoſe that made profeſsion thereof, at the leaſt the preeſtes, had taken an othe to the Pope, (as they do in euery place where they come) which they preferred before the othe, they had made to the countrey: inſomuch, that in the aſſemblie of the Eſtates at Leyden, as alſo in the league of the countreys of Holland and Zealande, this article was with one conſent agreed vpon,<note place="margin">The cauſes vvherefore ſome of the Romishe Church, vvithdrevv them ſelues out of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande.</note> ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the enemies be ignoraunt of theſe thinges, ſeeing that in the treatie helde at Breda, about the queſtion of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (the enemies there propounding this, on their owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, that that chaunge fell out, by the guiding of certaine particular perſons) there was ſhewed vnto them, the conſent of all the townes vnder their ſeuerall ſeales. And nowe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeche you, what bonde coulde there remaine vnto me, ſeeing that they, vnto whom I had made a promiſe,<note place="margin">The eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of one onli re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Hol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lande and Zealand, &amp; vvherefore it vvas ſo done.</note> did not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge me thereof: but they them ſelues alſo, did cut it in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, breake it, and made it of no force? And notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſding, I will leaue it to the iudgement of the wiſe, whether therein I haue done well or euill. This only I ſay, that when ſuch things were propounded, I deſired them, that they would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede ſo farre, and therefore much more, when they did exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and perfourme the ſame: whereof not onely my Lordes of Hollande and Zealande, but alſo, certaine troubleſome, &amp; waieward perſons, amongeſt vs (who alſo haue ſpread abroad againſt me in ſtraunge countreis, their wicked ſpeaches) will giue me ſo good a teſtimonie, that I hope I ſhall not neede anie great defence, againſt ſuch accuſations, which being by me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied as falſe (for ſo they are in deede) I feare not that they ſhal be able to yeelde any proofe thereof: leauing it to you (my Lordes) to iudge, howe fooliſhe ſuch an accuſation is, whiche maie be beaten backe, with a ſimple deniall, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the greateſt parte of the goodlie colours, wherewith this painter boaſteth that he hath ſet me out, may be quite &amp; cleane defaced, with ſuch a ſponge only. If they will alleadge,
<pb facs="tcp:7223:35"/>that yet notwithſtanding they, that were driuen out, haue iuſt occaſion to complaine, becauſe that promiſe was not kept with them: I aunſwere, that albeit this is not directed againſt me, yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, for the defence of the Eſtates of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande and Zealande, I will ſaie this much, that this complaint, ſhould haue but a verie ill foundation, becauſe it is not reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that any ſuch people ſhoulde enioye a priuiledge, by meanes of which they would deliuer the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies handes. Their purpoſe was, to betraie the liues, and the goods of the ſubiectes, and not one or two or three priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges onely, but all the fraunchiſes and liberties, preſerued time out of minde, and from age to age, by our predeceſſours and aunceſtours.</p>
            <p>They add withall, <hi>That I haue procured libertie of conſcience.</hi> If they vnderſtande thereby, that I haue made an open way to ſuch impieties, as are commonly committed in the houſe of the Prince of Parme, where Atheiſtrie, and other vertues of Rome, are counted but ſporte: I aunſwere, that it is amongeſt the heires of the Lord Peter Lewis, where a man muſt ſeeke &amp; finde ſuch libertie, or rather vnbridled licence. But I will in deede confeſſe, that the brightnes of the fiers, wherein they haue tormented ſo many poore chriſtians, was neuer deliteful or pleaſaunt to myne eyes, as it hath reioyſed the ſight of the Duke of Alua and the Spaniardes: and that I haue alwayes bin of this minde, to wiſhe and procure what I could, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions might ceaſe, in the lowe Countreys. I will more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer confeſſe vnto you, to the ende, that the enemies maye knowe, that they haue to doo with one, that ſpeaketh round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie &amp; without anie painting, to witte, that the King, when he departed out of Zealande, (whiche was the laſt place that he left in this Countrey) commaunded me, to put to death, manie godly and vertuous people that were ſuſpected to be of the Religion. Which thing I would not perfourme, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed them them ſelues thereof, knowing in deede, that I could not doo it with a good and ſafe conſcience, and that I was rather to obeye GOD, than man. Let the Spaniardes then ſpeake, what they them ſelues ſhall thinke good, I
<pb facs="tcp:7223:35"/>knowe that ſundrie peoples and nations, whiche are much better then they, who alſo haue learned, that by fire and ſworde, men little or nothing preuayle, would prayſe mee, and approue my fact.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing that you (my Lordes) together with the generall conſent of the people, haue ſince that tyme approoued it, in condemning the rigour, of the placardes and licences, and in cauſing thoſe cruell executions to ceaſe, I doo no whit at all regarde that, which the Spaniardes and their adherentes, do murmure and whiſper, concerning the ſame. Neither can I ſufficiently wonder at their follie,<note place="margin">They that ill intreated the preeſtes, vvere puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note> when they are not aſhamed to obiect vnto me, the murtheringes of the people of their Church, ſeeing, that not onely they knowe my naturall diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to be altogether eſtraunged from ſuch violences: but alſo that you and the whole worlde, doo verie well knowe, that by commaundement and appointement, ſome, in reſpect of ſuch outrages, as theſe men would charge me withall, were put to death: and other ſome, being of great note and noble houſes, were arreſted, by the principall ſeruauntes of my houſholde, and after that they had bin kept priſoners a long time, they were not deliuered, but in reſpecte of the houſe, from whence they had this honour, to proceede and come: the long impriſonment of their perſons being appointed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, for the puniſhment which they had deſerued. But that whiche was done by my charge and appointement, is in ſuch ſorte knowne to all the worlde, that they are not able, eyther to diſguiſe or darken the ſame, onely (as they haue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well learned to ſpeake trueth) that which I haue done ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſlie, they ſaye, that I haue feigned, that the thing did diſpleaſe me. But who hath tolde them that I feigned? Or who is he that hath reuealed vnto them ſo much of my ſecreates? They ſee that which I haue done, they can not iudge my hearte, neyther is there anie man ſo malitious, (except it be the forger of this writing, or ſome Spaniarde) whiche ought not rather to giue iudgement vppon that whiche he ſeeth, than vppon that, whiche he malitiouſlie and wickedlie ſuſpecteth.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7223:36"/>
            <p>The caſt alſo infinite blames and ſlaunders, vpon our religion, and they call vs heretiques. But it is ſuch as a long time ſince, they tooke vpon them to proue it, and yet were neuer able to bring it to purpoſe or effect. And I ſaie, that theſe iniuries (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like vnto the wordes of women, prouoked &amp; chafed with collor) do not deſerue any aunſwere, much leſſe that beaſtli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſaie, that I neuer truſted any eyther Preeſt or Friar, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he were maried, and that I inforced them to marie. For, who is it that knoweth not, that without choiſe or diſcretion, they caſt at my head, euery thing that they finde in the waye, ſo great is their furie, and their paſsion ſo outragious and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable? And albeit that theſe things were true,<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the mariage of Preeſtes.</note> as in deed they are not, neither yet reaſonable (for we learne by our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that mariage ought to be free, and ſhould not be either inforced or forbidden) yet ſo it is, that this faulte ſhould not be comparable, with that tyrannie ouer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, which hath forbidden mariage to a great part of Chriſtendome, againſt which forbidding, nor onely the Eaſt churches oppoſed them ſelues, but alſo the churches of Germanie and Fraunce.</p>
            <p>But that (my Lordes) which is greatly to be eſteemed in this Proſcription, ſo true and well grounded, is this, <hi>That the King commanded not the Duke of Alua, to impoſe the tenth and twentieth pennie, without the conſent of the people.</hi> If the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Duke of Alua, in a matter of ſo great importaunce, and whiche was the cauſe of the death and deſtruction, of ſo many thouſandes of men, hath paſſed his commiſsion, what puniſhment folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereof? The Duke of Alua, for hauing perfourmed to his owne ſonne this dutie, to wit, that he might marie his couſin, leauing another, whom vnder the colour of mariage accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, he had abuſed, (euen as Rigomes had before perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the King, as before hath bin declared) was caſt into priſon, and put out of fauour, and ſhoulde not as yet haue bin deliuered, if in all Spaine they had bin able to haue founde a tyraunt,<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the tenth &amp; tvventith pennie.</note> more fitt to exerciſe tyrannie vpon the poore Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales then he. He was then chaſtiſed for a ſmall faulte, and for ſuch a great one, he was honoured, much made of, and filled with rewardes: And he that would preſſe the King, with the
<pb facs="tcp:7223:36"/>death of my Lordes of Egmount and of Hornes, he would ſay as much, and diſallowe againe the Duke of Alua for it. Is not this a good meane thinke ye, to diſcharge him ſelfe of all faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes? But let them take which parte they will, either the King commaunded it, and then he can not auoyde the name of a tyraunt, or els he commaunded it not, and yet for all that the name of a tyraunt ſhall remaine vnto him, becauſe he did not chaſtiſe and correct him, who of his owne priuate authoritie, had vſurped ſuch a tyrannie, vppon a franck and free people, whereby it appeareth, that he is culpable thereof. And albeit, that I haue alwayes eſteemed the Duke of Alua, for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of the Countrey, and as one who hath willingly bathed him ſelfe in our blood, and in the blood of all Chriſtians, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying cloſely a Turkiſhe hearte within him: yet ſo it is, that I haue knowne him to well, and haue bin to to much practiſed to beleeue this, that he ſhould be ſo ſottiſhe, and ſo preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, as to dare to attempt, to laye vpon the people an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of ſuch conſequence, and to purſue it ſo long time, and that by ſuch extraordinarie, yea &amp; altogether inſupportable meanes to the countrey, without good and ſufficient co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement directed vnto him therefore, and that not once only, but ſundrie times. I beſeeche you (my Lordes) to weye this well, whether he, that in his owne proper and priuate name, durſt condemne, or fauoure them that did condemne, the Burgmaſter of Amſtelredam, in fiue and twentie thouſande Florins of amercement, becauſe he ſet him ſelfe againſt the tenth pennie, was not well aſſured, and had not ſufficient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge for the ſame from his Superior? Neither neede we (my Lordes) any other place then this, whereby to knowe, the fraudes, diſsimulations and craftes, wherewith the King, hath ſo long a time, led and deceaued vs, and yet purpoſeth ſtill to do, if we ſuffer him to wound vs, with the prick of his tongue, or to aſtoniſhe vs, with the threatnings of his armies. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, he will haue the bruite thereof, ſounded abroad, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Townes taken, and ſurpriſed in Hollande, to witte, within this two, three, or foure veeres, and that with more force then he hath fought againſt the Turke withall: I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
<pb facs="tcp:7223:37"/>him, that, hauing the aduantages whereof he braggeth, he ought to conſider, whether this tende not to his very great ſhame, that he is altogether driuen out of that Countrey. And it ſtandeth him not in any ſteede, to alleadge, the mutinie of the Spaniardes. For a Gouernour, and ſpecially ſuch a one as had ſuch great meanes as hee had, doeth ſufficientlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraie his inſufficiencie &amp; vnworthineſſe to commaunde, when he is not able by ſuch meanes, to keepe in obedience his own Souldiers: on the other ſide, in excuſing him ſelfe ſo fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, he ſeeth whether he will or no, that he is inforced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that I, and my Lordes of Hollande and Zealande, hauing verie ſlender meanes, as namely but foure or fiue thouſande men, haue broken his attemptes, and cauſed him to conſume three ſcore thouſande. And whileſt (my Lordes) he thus in this countrey loſt his time, his men, and his money, he loſt likewiſe within two monethes, the Kingdome of Tunis, and the Goulette,<note place="margin">The shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful loſtes of the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of Thunis &amp; the Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette.</note> with the greateſt ſhame and confuſion, that euer anie mightie Prince did, yea though he were driuen out of his owne lande, albeit ſome would laie the faulte hereof, vppon the youth of Don Iohn, &amp; vpon the whoredome of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall. For whileſt he did ſo ill imploye his forces here amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt vs, Sinam Baſſcha, tooke from him that Kingdome, and that fortreſſe, which men ſuppoſed could neuer haue bin taken: &amp; this he did in the ſight of Spaine and of Sicilia, without that euer anie of the Kings ſide, durſt ſo much as ſhewe his head, to fight againſt him, or onely to turne him aſide. And yet, if he had no regarde to the good of Chriſtendome (which in deed he neuer had, as witneſſeth the painted league that he made, which alſo coſt the Venetians ſo much) nor reſpect to his own honour, at the leaſt, the memorie and name of the Emperour his father, (who did little or nothing regarde, all his notable deedes and feates of armes, in reſpect of that conqueſt) ought to haue moued and thruſt him forwarde, with a noble and earneſt deſire, wiſely to haue mainteyned that, which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour his father had ſo valiauntly conquered for him and all Chriſtendome. But the rage and furie to deſtroye vs, which caried him awaie, tooke both his eyes from him, that he could
<pb facs="tcp:7223:37"/>not ſee that euill, and his vnderſtanding alſo that he could not diſcerne it, he louing ouermuch to make proofe, rather of his weakenes againſt his owne proper people, then of his forces, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the common and vniuerſall enemie of Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>This (my Lordes) is that which he obiecteth againſt me, &amp; which alſo fell out, before our generall coniunction, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together. Wherevnto (it may be) it was not altogether neceſſarie to aunſwere, ſauing that it is requiſite, not onely to ſatisfie you, but alſo to ſtoppe their mouthes, and to make all the worlde to vnderſtande their impudencies and ſlaunders. For, if the queſtion were, but of that which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and thoſe whiche heretofore were on our ſide, who haue notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, verie euelly and without any cauſe, withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them ſelues from vs: you, and thoſe with you, haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſufficiently declared, that you had a farre better opinion of me. For firſt, the accorde treated of by you, with me &amp; my Lordes of Hollande and Zealande, at Gaunt, hath ſufficientlie iuſtified me, ſeeing that if you had ſuppoſed me to be ſuch a one, as this infamous Proſcription deſcribeth me, you neyther would nor could haue entered into treatie with me: beſide, ſo many honorable embaſſages, as you ſince that time haue ſent vnto me, to S. Gheertrudenberghe, and euen yet to Antwerp, both to cauſe me to come into Brabant, and to cauſe me to come vnto you to Bruxelles, that I might be aſsiſtaunt with you in Counſell: and alſo, that yee did honour me with the title of Lieutenaunt generall: All theſe things I ſaye, doo ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare, what is the opinion and iudgement that yee haue had, of all theſe falſe and friuoulous accuſations, whiche thing alone, I ſuppoſe, to be ouer ſufficient and ſtrong to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them.</p>
            <p>But let vs nowe ſee, howe before that time, they on their behalfes gouerned themſelues, with what pride, inſolencie, and diſdaine of our whole nation. I will not repeate, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries and deceites of the Dutcheſſe, nor of the King, in the behalfe of my Lordes the Counties of Egmount and of Horne, nor the baites and allurementes, which they prepared for me, nor yet generally that which fel out before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming
<pb facs="tcp:7223:38"/>of the Duke of Alua, but that onely whiche was done after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, vntill the time of our generall coniunction and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together, to the ende, that as the remembraunce of the miſchiefes and griefes paſt, ſhall bring vnto you pleaſure and contentement, and the ſame (as I hope) vnto me, who with ſome delite haue ayded you therin: ſo that by the ſame you will more and more ſtrengthen your ſelues, in this reſolution, which is both holie, and worthie of immortall prayſe, &amp; which you alſo haue taken vpon you, that is, to oppoſe and ſet your ſelues againſt the Spaniardes and their adherentes. Nowe, as well the ſaide Duke of Alua, as thoſe that commaunded vnder him and after him, haue ſufficiently made vs to vnderſtande, what was at all times the counſell of Spaine, to wit, to roote vs out, and to bring vs into bondage. For, as Hanniball, euen when he was but nine yeeres olde did ſweare, by the altar of his goddes, that he would be al his life long, an enemie to the Romanes: ſo was this Duke of Alua, from his childhood nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and brought vp, in an vnreconcilable hatred againſt this countrey,<note place="margin">The inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable pride of the Duke of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua, &amp; other officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes.</note> which, by ſo much blood as he hath ſpilt, could as yet neuer be ſatisfied, but ſo much the more hath he cauſed it to runne out on euerie ſide, in all the Townes of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, yea ſo farre forth, that he hath cauſed to be put to death (which thing alſo he him ſelfe bragged of) eightene thouſand poore innocent men and more, and that by the handes of the hangman or tormentor, and yet for all that, that cruell luſt of his, could neuer be ſatisfied. So that if any would knowe, what are the priuie counſells of Spaine: what is the Kings good wil, and howe much he loueth vs, he ſhall finde it all deciphered &amp; ſett out, in the bloodie deedes of the Duke of Alua, as if it were ſet out before his eyes, and liuely painted in a table of painters worke. For there hath not bin any kinde of diſsimulation, treaſon, and vnfaithfulnes, which he hath not vſed, that hee might bring vnder his ſubiection and ſeruice, the principall Lordes of this Countrey, and that by offers, promiſes, &amp; newe titles of Honour, beſtowed vpon them. But, the good &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous people, that he could get into his handes, he hath cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly put to death, without any reſpect, either to their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<pb facs="tcp:7223:38"/>or to the priuiledges of the countrey, and yet nothing was done, but by the Kings commaundement. He committed the like, againſt the Citezens and good Marchauntes, ſo proudly treding vnder feete, our auncient liberties and freedomes, yea euery thing, that was remayning amongeſt vs of the glorie of our aunceſtours, that it ſeemed that he thought, that you were at no hande worthie to be reckoned, in the number of men. And where is it, that we can haue a more certaine and playne proofe, and that ſo open, that it is (as it were) in the ſight and beholding of all Chriſtendome, concerning this matter,<note place="margin">the profane and proude erection, of the Duke of Alua his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, in the midſt of the late Citadel at Antvverp</note> and withall, of his vnſupportable contempt and diſdaine of all theſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis, then in that proude, ambitious, profane, heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe, and withall fooliſhe ſetting vp of his owne Image, in the middeſt of the Cittadell at Antwerpe, going impudently vpon the bellies of the Noble men, of the Eſtates, and of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this countrey? Was not this thinke you, a notable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of his tyrannie, and a teſtimonie of his pride? What ſhall I neede to ſpeake of his ſeruauntes, and of all that vermin that came out of Spaine, who ſpake of vs, not as it were of Villacos (as they vſe to ſay) or villaines, but euen as it were of brute beaſtes? You (my Lordes) haue euen as yet your eares, altogether beaten with ſuch matters, and you are able to ſet out their geſtures, their proceedinges, their wordes full of boldneſſe, of pride, and of contempt: alſo their vnſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actes, and howe when they were within your townes, with what pride and inſolencie they did commaunde you. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if that be true which wiſe men report, that, for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the naturall diſpoſition of a Lorde or Noble man, men muſt examine him by his friendes and familiars: and for the knowledge of a maiſter, men muſt ſift his ſeruauntes: you may (my Lordes) by the vertues of the Duke of Alua, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters principall officer, and the executor of all his counſels, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely iudge, what good affection and wil, the King beareth you, who ſent him to you, to torment you: and alſo ye may knowe what yee ought to looke for, vnleſſe yee prouide for it in time, (as in deede yee ought) which thing alſo, all the good people of this lande looke for at your handes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7223:39"/>
            <p>I will ſpeake nothing, of the rauiſhings, raunſomes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions committed by the Spaniardes, I wil onely ſtaie my ſelf vpon the principall point. Yee could neuer yet tell, howe to obtaine a free aſſemblie,<note place="margin">The aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of the Eſtates ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, euer refuſed.</note> of the Eſtates generall, your enemie verie wel knowing, that, to hinder the calling together &amp; mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, was in deede to cut of by the foote, the tree of your priuiledges, and vtterly to drie vp the ſpring of your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. For, to what ende ſerueth it the people, to haue priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in faire parchement, kept vp in a cofer, if by the meane of the Eſtates, thoſe priuiledges be not mainteined, and ſo men feele the effectes thereof? And in deede long time before, the King him ſelfe had receaued a diſpenſation from the Pope,<note place="margin">The King taketh a diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>penſation from the Pope, for his othe made at his gladſome entraunce.</note> for the othe which he had made vnto you, to keepe your priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Wherein he did not onely violate and break his faith: but alſo did ouer eaſely, yea verie hurtfully beleeue, fooliſhe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours, whereby he to to manifeſtly declared, howe great his owne wiſedome was. For, might he not verie well vnderſtand, that, counting him ſelf free from the othe, which he had made to you, you alſo were freed and quitt from your othe towards him? In ſo much, that he, minding to be vnburdened of his othe towardes you, you ought not vnto him, any obedience and ſubiection. That I may at this time ſay nothing, but leaue it vnto others more exerciſed in ſuch matters than I, to handle this queſtion, whether the Pope may iuſtlie vaunt, that he hath anie ſuch power and authoritie, yea or no: and whether anie thing in the world, ſhall remaine certaine and ſure, if othes ſo ſolemnely made, may, vnder ſuch a pretext and cloake, be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and broken. At the ſame time, mariages made out of the countrey, were wholy forbidden, and that whiche was neuer practiſed, was prohibited, to wit, that youth might not go out of the countrey, to ſtudie in any other ſchoole of the worlde, but in that at Rome: and condemning by that meanes, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſchooles (whiche is an ouer great arrogancie) they did condemne (ſo vnwarie they were) euen thoſe of the Ieſuites,<note place="margin">The ſcholes of all the vvorld for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaue that of Rome only</note> without thinking anie whit of them: and ſo (whiche is in deede the worſt) they opened a waye, to verie barbarouſnes. For, as the meetinges together of all maneer of learned men,
<pb facs="tcp:7223:39"/>hath brought forth vnto vs in this Countrey, ſundrie perſons well qualified, who haue greatly innobled theſe Prouinces: ſo this interdiction and forbidding, could not but in proceſſe of time cauſe, a more than Turkiſhe ignoraunce, that I maye ſaye nothing of this, that by that meanes, they would make this Countrey ſubiect,<note place="margin">The publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the councell of Trent.</note> to ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions as neuer were heard of. About the ſame time, the Councell of Trente was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, which Councell hath ſeemed, euen to the Frenchmen them ſelues, ſo vniuſt, that euen vnto this daye, it could not as yet be publiſhed, in the kingdome of Fraunce.</p>
            <p>A little while before this time, there was egerlie purſued, and at the laſt obteyned, the inſtalling of the newe Biſhoppes, whiche had bin ſo long tyme before debated,<note place="margin">Bishoppes nevvly made.</note> by reaſon of the inconueniences, which all wiſe people, and louers of the Countrey, and haters of the tourmenting of mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, did foreſee, would inſue therevppon: which thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I my ſelfe, write euen vnto the King: that I may ſaye no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, of the warninges, that I gaue to the Dutcheſſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in open counſell, and oftentimes els where: all theſe their purpoſes, tending to no other ende, but to ſet vpp the cruell Inquiſition of Spaine, and to eſtabliſhe the ſayde Biſhoppes, that they might ſerue, in ſteede of Inquiſitours, burners of mens bodies, and tyrauntes ouer their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
            <p>It is true, that at this daye they denie, that euer they ment to bring in, this curſed Inquiſition, but, if I bring forth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them a man worthie of creditt, who was at that tyme a Penſioner of Franck, and who had the racke twiſe ſhewed him, to be tormented vppon it, that he might confeſſe, who they were of the Lordes of the ſaide Franck, which were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to refuſe the Inquiſition: will they ſaie that he is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged witneſſe, who yet notwithſtanding is ſuch a one, as they are not able to obiect any thing againſt him? And beſide, if need were, I could finde inough other, plaine, &amp; moſt manifeſt proofes.

<pb facs="tcp:7223:40"/>of the ſaide Biſhoppes, doeth plainlie carie with it this much, that euery Biſhopp, might giue in his owne Cathedral church, two prebends: that euery one of the Canons, ſhould be boud, to aſsiſt him in the matter of the Inquiſition: and that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularlie, two amongeſt them, ſhould actually, and in deede be Inquiſitours. And as Princes or tyrauntes, which poſſeſſe new Kingdomes or Lordſhippes, do laye vppon them a tribute, in ſigne of their victorie: ſo the Duke of Alua, in teſtimonie of his conqueſt (for this was his common ſpeache, to witte, that theſe countreis, apperteyned to the King, not in title, or by right or patrimonie, but as being conquered, by armour and weapons) then I ſaie, to the ende he might make all the world to vnderſtande the condition, wherevnto he had made ſubiect this countrey, he laide vpon the people, by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Maiſter, the perpetuall payment of the tenth pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, without the conſent of the Eſtates,<note place="margin">The impoſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the tenth pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie, vvithout the good vvil, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Eſtates.</note> without the conſent of the Townes &amp; Prouinces, and he reſolued with him ſelfe &amp; his people, to execute the ſame by force. Inſomuch, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vn derſtood, that certaine noble &amp; couragious harts, began to be moued, euen at the verie houre (ye ſee my Lordes, howe great Gods prouidence is) when he receaued newes of the taking of the Briele, he was reſolued, to put to death, the ſame night the principall Burgeſſes and Citizens of Bruxelles, becauſe, that they ſet them ſelues againſt this impoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie publiſhed againſt their priuiledges. The Hangman, named Maiſter Charles, was commaunded to haue in a readines, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteene halters, and certaine ladders of ten or twelue foote hie: the ſouldiers were vp in armes: Don Frederico, came into the houſe, of Viglius the Preſident, to conclude the ſpeache of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation, when theſe happie newes, againſt the good Burgeſſes and Citizens of Bruxelles, arriued there.

            <p>Euerie one may remember, the mutuall promiſes of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe, of intelligences, partaking of counſell, and ſuch like comprehended therein. But what? They them ſelues, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes did make manifeſt, the great and inueterate hatred of their heart, and were notwithſtanding of the number of
<pb facs="tcp:7223:41"/>thoſe, which treated of the ſame matter with my Deputies, &amp; with them of Hollande and Zealande: they I ſay, intreating thereof, did ouerthwartly caſt againſt it, all the hinderaunces that poſsiblie they could, to cauſe it to die, before it came to ripenes: which thing, without controuerſie, they had obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if they had not feared to fall into daunger, &amp; if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and all the Prouinces (who perceaued, and ſawe before hande a farre of, that this pacification, ſhould be the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke of their libertie, and the reſtitution of their auncient priuiledges) had not, as it were with one voice, inforced them to conclude the ſame. And, becauſe (my Lordes) often times in this execrable Proſcription, and in their little, fooliſhe, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famatorie libelles, and ſecret letters, they obiect vnto me, that I haue violated and broken the ſame: Let vs ſee, howe they on their behalfe, haue mainteyned and kept it. It was no ſooner confirmed by othe, but that the Lorde of Hauſsi, according to your commaundement,<note place="margin">The Lorde of Haulſi, ſent into Zealand to demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cour of the L.

But, a certaine man, vnworthie of his ſtock, and of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, could not conteine him ſelfe, but at the ſame time began to vomite his venim, charging with a faulte the ſaide Lord, in reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence of ſo good a ſeruice, &amp; which was in deede the very gate, to the libertie of the Countrie and Countie of Flaunders, and namely of the towne of Gaunt, whiche had bin ſo long time before, kept vnder by tyrannie: and it was a matter of no great account, to the ſaide Sweueghen, to the Countie of Reus, Mouqueron, and others, that the Spaniardes, yet all bloodie with the murther of Antwerp, &amp; laden with the ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, of good Burgeſſes and Citezens, ſhould perfourme a like execution in the Towne of Gaunt, as they had committed in the moſt renoumned town of Antwerp: which thing alſo they had executed and performed, (as the letters of Rhoda and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, do ſufficiently proue) had not the ſaide ſuccour hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them. Marke I pray you, howe that euen then when the Trumpet ſounded, for to publiſhe the Pacification of Gaunt,
<pb facs="tcp:7223:41"/>theſe honeſt people began to breake the ſame. Herevpon Don Iohn arriued in theſe Countreys,<note place="margin">the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iohn</note> and albeit that mine enemie would here playe the falſifier, and alter the matter: haue not I yet the letter ſigned with the Kings owne hande, and with the hande of one of the Secretaries of his eſtate, &amp; ſealed with the ſeale of his armes, whiche yeelde teſtimonie concerning the charge and commiſsion giuen to Don Iohn? Haue not they bin publiſhed to all the world? Was there yet euer any Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde founde, that durſt contend againſt him? By thoſe letters we haue knowne, that all the difference, betweene Don Iohn, the Duke of Alua, and Lewis of Requeſens was this, that he was more young, and more fooliſhe, than the others, and that he could not ſo long time hide his venime, diſſemble his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes, &amp; withhold his greedie handes, from the deſire that he had, to wett and waſhe them in our blood. I will not (my Lordes) make in this place any recitall of theſe matters vnto you, for they are knowne vnto litle children, and all the land, is as it were, watered therewith. Albeit then that theſe things were ſet out before the whole worlde: and albeit that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifiers knewe and vnderſtood the ſame: Notwithſtanding the inueterate hatred towardes this poore people was ſo great (ſo much were they accuſtomed, to aide them that oppreſſed your priuiledges, and to ſubiect them ſelues to tyrannie, was euen become altogether naturall vnto them) that euen like horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaches, foming with rage, they themſelues came to launce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, vpon the thorne of the bloodie hart of Don Iohn, and agreed with him, againſt mine aduiſe, and the aduiſe of them of Hollande and Zealand, and againſt their owne othe taken, againſt the pacification of Gaunt, and yet theſe men dare ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto me the pacification and mine othe, as though thoſe bandes had bin prepared, onely to ſhakel me, and my Lordes of Hollande and Zealande, whileſt that thoſe good and loyall peacemakers, hauing broken all bond of lawes, of loyaultie, and of fidelitie, might haue libertie to perpetrate, commit, and doo, whatſoeuer their diſloyall harte, ſhoulde put them in minde of. They will ſaye, that they cauſed Don Iohn to promiſe, that the Spaniardes ſhould departe: as though
<pb facs="tcp:7223:42"/>that all our agreement and league, conſiſted in that onely point. But before they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded with Don Iohn, ſhould not they haue placed me, in my gouernementes, and put me in poſſeſsion of my goodes, and reſtored me my Sonne, who was one of the number of the priſoners? Haue they ſo much as onely thought vpon it, though that ſundrie amongeſt them were kinne vnto him? No whitt at all in deede. For they had a farre other marke, which thing they them ſelues did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare, by ſo many conſultations as they made, that they might at the length finde out a way to oppreſſe me, and to bring Hollande and Zealande vnder ſubiection, knowing, that at the ſame time, I yet onely, and the Eſtates of the ſaide Countreis, were they which did openly hinder their pernitious purpoſes, which was, to enter in the place of the Spaniardes, to exerciſe the like tyrannie that the Spaniards had done, but yet as they thought, with more power and authoritie, and alſo, that they might remaine in their own Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treyes with greater impunitie. Concerning this matter, I referre my ſelfe to the inſtructions, giuen to thoſe which came to treate with me, at Saint Geertrudenberghe, whiche I will bring to light, if need be thereof.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, they ſent to the Queene of Englande, that they might fill hir with al falſe matters againſt me, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo moue hir to arme hir ſelfe againſt me and my Lordes, the Eſtates of Hollande and Zealande: But the knowledge that ſhe had of the trueth, and the ſingular wiſedome, wherewith ſhe is indued, made hir to take a cleane contrarie reſolution, then that which they hoped of. To be ſhort, they deuiſed as much ae they could, to execute and perfourme againſt vs, the ſame practiſes that the Spaniardes had done, and this (my Lordes) was the obſeruation of the Pacification of Gaunt, that theſe men vſed euen from the beginning. And as concerning the Spaniardes,<note place="margin">The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Don Iohn to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</note> which Don Iohn told them he had ſent away, they ſawe (at the leaſt if they had anie vnderſtanding, though neuer ſo little, for they wanted not aduertiſement and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence) that ſome ſtayed in Luxembourgh, other ſome in Bur gundie, and other ſome in Fraunce, vnder the ſhadowe of the
<pb facs="tcp:7223:42"/>ciuile warre, which was at that time raiſed vp in Fraunce, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king onely for their watchwoorde, that they might returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in an inſtant, whiche thing alſo they did. Beſide this, they knew, that Don Iohn reteined with him foureteene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande Germanes, of the old ſouldiours, which he kept in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,<note place="margin">Foureteene thouſande La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceknigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes left by Don Iohn in garriſon, in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal towns</note> in the principall Townes of the Countrey: that at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, he treated with the ſaide Germanes: that he ſpake one thing to them, and another thing to you my Lordes: and did in the meane while, take the Caſtle of Antwerp, from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Duke of Aerſchot, and of the Prince of Chimai his ſonne, and left it in the handes of Treſlon. They ſawe I ſaye, theſe thinges, and did notwithſtanding ayde and fauour him therein, and yet they will ſay that they kept the Pacification of Gaunt. For, as concerning that whiche mine enemies ſaye, that Don Iohn ſware vnto it, I confeſſe further, that the King him ſelfe promiſed, it ſhould be obſerued, which maketh him ſo much the more vanquiſhed, for euen at the ſame time, he commaunded Don Iohn to breake it, as appeareth by his own letters.</p>
            <p>And as concerning Don Iohn, true it is, that he promiſed and ſware, to ſee the ſame perfourmed, but that was with a condition, which he ſpake of before hande,<note place="margin">Don Iohn ſvvare to the pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> in the preſence euen of ſome of your Deputies, whiche ſhould be added, to witt, that it ſhould be kept vntill ſuch time, as he repented him thereof, which condition fell out verie quicklie afterwarde. For, this young man, ſuppoſing that he was at the topp of his buſineſſe, and that he had in his handes (by reaſon of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons of Germains, and ſundrie traytours taking parte with them) the beſt Townes, tooke (but yet not without doing, an vuworthie iniurie to the Queene of Nauarre) the Caſtle of Namure, a place which he thought was verie fitt and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for the Spaniardes to go and come. But ſo ſoone, as the Caſtle of Antwerpe, was by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition yeelded vp vnto you, he founde him ſelfe farre from his reckoning, which cauſed him at one time to loſe, manie friendes, who began euen than to chaunge their copie and countenaunce: and Don Iohn was thereby made, ſo perplex and doubtfull, that he had no other
<pb facs="tcp:7223:43"/>ſuccour, but this, that, hauing corrupted ſome of your owne Deputies, he might protract the time, and buſie you, with a painted hope of peace. And I would to God, that at that time, yee (my Lordes) had not bin hindered, by theſe good obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the Pacification of Gaunt, from beleeuing my counſel, for then, by a verie ſmall armie, we might haue bin quitt and ridde of Don Iohn, of his Spaniardes and adherentes, and of ſo many miſeries, as ſince haue inſued. I would then yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowe, in this place (my Lordes) whether Don Iohn did then keepe this Pacification, &amp; his Vnion ſo ſolemnely ſworne (as they ſaie) which he had made, with theſe fauourers of the Spaniardes. And why ſhall he come to vpbraide me with the Pacification of Gaunt, which yet hath cauſed this to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs, by the Lorde of Selles, that he would not keepe it? Shall he to my hurt, enioye a priuiledge, which he him ſelf renounceth and forſaketh? And when we haue ſaide all, it is not with him, that I, and the Eſtates of Hollande and Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, haue contracted and accorded, but it is with you (my Lordes.) Now, if after ſo many breaches of the Pacification, and that in ſuch ſundrie ſortes: if after that contrarie to the ſaide Pacificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they haue deſtroyed the Townes, where they could exerciſe their tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nous gouernement, and the beſt Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes and Citezens therein, alleadging againſt them falſe and wicked thinges: If then I ſaye, after theſe thinges, you (my Lordes) haue iudged, that for your owne ſuretie, you ought to inlarge ſome of the articles, yea and if neede were, that you were minded, altogether to breake, cut in ſunder, and reuoke them: who is he that could accuſe you therefore, If yee haue vſed that which was your owne, as you your ſelues thought it conuenient for your owne profit, vnleſſe it be he, which would vſe his owne othe, as a nett and ſnare to catche you in? For as concerning that whiche they ſay, that the chaunge hath bin on my behalfe: though that were true, yet ſo it is, that I am no more bounde, in reſpect of the contractours with me, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they haue ſo manie wayes, violated and broken the contracte it ſelfe: and ſeeing that on your part, it was thought conueuient, that the chaunge ſhould be made, you haue as
<pb facs="tcp:7223:43"/>much authoritie and power to diſpoſe thereof, as a Lord hath right in his own inheritaunce: for the Pacification was yours, which alſo you might vſe, at your own pleaſure and diſcretion.</p>
            <p>But I haue ſo often times, both by worde and writing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, nothing to be broken on our partes, that I ſhall not neede to beſtowe anie more time, to ſett out the ſame vnto you: Onely I will confeſſe this, that they of Hollande and Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande were in deede forbidden, to innouate or chaunge anie thing in that countrey: but that the other Eſtates, might not in their Prouinces, by ſome lawefull condition,<note place="margin">Nothing vvas atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the L.

And in deede, vpon the making of the ſaide Pacification, as one of thoſe which were Deputies on our ſide, did declare vnto ſome one of the principall perſons of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, that ſome ſuch matter might fall out, and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was better, to accorde ſome libertie, for the poore ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes of the Prouinces, whoſe cauſes they handeled, and for whom they were to make agreement: ſo ſome other aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him againe, that he needed not take care for ſuch matters, and that thoſe of Brabant, Flaunders, and the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis, would not at any time demaunde a chaunge in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion. Nowe, if they haue bin deceaued, what cauſe is there for them ſo furiouſlie, to direct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues againſt me? I giue them alſo the ſame aunſwere, in reſpecte of the chaunge which fell out, in certaine Townes of my gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for I can in deed aſſure me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before God, that I haue not giuen any aduiſe or conſent thereto: and that many things fel out ther, as alſo in Flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, which pleaſed me no whit at all: and I do defende it againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if there haue bin, ſome ſouldiarlike inſolencie &amp; viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that that was nothing, but ſweete ſmelling roſes, in reſpect of the intollerable exceſſes, which thei haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted: and alſo at the leaſt, that we haue not had on our parte, any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie or treaſon, or intelligence with the Spaniardes, as our enimies on their parte haue had. For haue not they, againſt their faith &amp; promiſe, with an armed power begunne a warre,

The ſtories report, that Suffetius was drawen in peeces with foure horſes, becauſe he ſtirred not, but only looked on, when Tullus Hoſtilius his confederate, fought the fielde: then what Gibbettes, and what puniſhmentes can a man deuiſe, whiche might be ſufficient to correct, this vnfaithfulneſſe and treaſon?

They will ſay, that I haue not ſhewed my ſelfe to be an enemie againſt them of our ſide, who haue paſſed the boundes ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Verely I haue not approued the exceſſe of any, but doo they thinke that I am ſo vnwarie, as that for to ſhewe them a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I will open a gapp to the deſtruction of the Countrey, and ſo make Eſcouedo a prophet? Haue they euer heard that a wiſe father, for the contentement of his enemie, would ſeeke the ruyne of his children? Nay rather this is his dutie, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb facs="tcp:7223:44"/>the faultes, and in amending of them, to labor the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his familie and houſholde.</p>
            <p>But Bours, Montigni, and others, doo not they knowe the duties that I haue performed, to eſtabliſh euery thing in good order? Haue they forgotten the Articles, agreed vppon, euen ſuch as they them ſelues demaunded, &amp; which ſince that time, they haue broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt their othe? It is then rage, follie, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, hatred againſt the religion, &amp; deſire to gouerne, which hath caried away their heartes, and toſſed them as it were with madnes: and which hath firſt moued them: and which ſince that time they haue couered, with the cloake of the Pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gaunt. For I knowe (my Lordes) howe hardly they were diſtreſſed, and what labor they tooke, to cloake and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour their enterpriſe, and that a ſimple Captaine, did in this counſaile open a gappe vnto them, who was immediatelie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
            <p>I knowe, that ſundrie wil thinke it a newe &amp; ſtraunge thing, that children of ſo good a houſe, iſſuing from ſuch fathers, ſhould ſo farre forgett them ſelues, as to heape vp ſuch repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches vpon their owne ſtock: yea ſome I thincke will thincke it vnbeleeuable, that euer there coulde be founde, ſuch great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie in them: and for myne owne part, I can not chuſe, but be greatly ſorie for it, by reaſon of the good will anſt reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which I haue borne to their fathers: and the deſire which I haue had to ſee them aduaunced, in al vertue, honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation (which thing they might haue atteyned, if they had onely learned to forbeare but a little while, and to beare ſome part of the miſerie of their countrey) and I would yet in deede deſire, that they might become ſo wiſe, that by a good repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, they might amende the faultes paſt. But to the ende, that I may not ſpeake, of ſundrie their particular actions, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are not come to the ſight of al the world, and are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding full of inconſtancie and lightnes: if we come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that which euery one knoweth, and is laide out before the eyes of all the world, who is he that can ſufficiently inough marueile, at the inconſtancie and vanitie of their reſolutions? They ſerued the Duke of Alua, and the great Commandador,
<pb facs="tcp:7223:45"/>as ſeruauntes or pages, and they made warre againſt me, with all extremitie: a little while afterwards, they treated with me, and reconciled them ſelues, and then (lo) they were the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes enemies. Don Iohn came, they followe him, they ſerue him, and they indeuour and practiſe my deſtruction. Don Iohn failed in his enterpriſes, concerning the Caſtle of Antwerpe, inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently they forſake him &amp; call me: I was no ſooner come, but contrarie to their othe, without communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating anie thing thereof, either to you (my Lordes) or to me, they call my Lorde Matthias the Archduke: He being come, they ſawe that they could not come to their marke, therefore they left him, and without aduertiſing him any thing at all thereof, they go to ſeeke my Lorde the Duke of Aniou: they bring him in, and they promiſe him wonderfull things. They ſawe, that they could not bring him to this point, to make him a Captaine againſt you (my Lords) and them of the Religion, then they left him, and ioyned them ſelues to the Prince of Parma.

And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this point, I will not ſticke at it, to aunſwere this ſlaunder, that I haue, and that by myne owne priuate authoritie, put into charge and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the ſaide officers, ſeeing that in euery place, where I haue bin aſsiſtaunt in the chaunging of the lawe, I haue therein exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted onely that charge and office, whiche it hath pleaſed you to giue me, and that as your Commiſsioner and Deputie, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing therein againſt the lawes and priuiledges. In deed I will confeſſe, that I ſought as much as poſsiblie I could, to bring in and to place in theſe offices, vertuous people, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſonages, men of good conſcience, and aboue all lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the countrey. But I knowe what wringeth and pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them, that is, that I did not willingly fauour thoſe, which they had in their owne corde, people without faith, without godlines and honeſtie towardes their Countrey, yea bloodie people, and ſlaues to execute their tyrannie. And this is that (my Lordes) which theſe men call confuſion, to wit the good rule and gouernement of our common wealth, according to our lawes, which alſo are as contrary to their barbarous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes and purpoſes, as the day is to the night. And in deede (my Lordes) there is no great neede, to aunſwere ſuch obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeeing that our owne enemie doth ſufficiently aunſwere them for vs. For, who were theſe officers, of whom they ſaye, we haue diſcharged and vnburdened our ſelues? <hi>They were</hi> (ſay they) <hi>well affected to the King.</hi> Which is as much as if they ſhould ſaie, they were good enemies to the Countrey: and by this (my Lordes) you vnderſtand, that it was verie well done to chaunge them, in ſundrie places and quarters.</p>
            <p>They vpbraide me, <hi>with the great credit that I haue amongest the people.</hi> So farre of is it, that I am aſhamed of this, that I am verie ſorie that I haue not as yet atteined more, that is to ſaye,

But if they be ſuch as they ſaye they are, and that I am ſuch a one as they deſcribe me to be (for to ſhewe them ſome pleaſure, I will eaſely graunt them this point) they muſt of neceſsitie confeſſe, that their tyrannies and cruelties, haue bin wonderfully exceſsiue and outrageous in all ſortes, in that they haue incurred, ſuch a generall hatred of all that people, who before were ſo well affected, and hath bin ſo loyall and faithful to their predeceſſors, and euen vnto them themſelues, before ſuch exceſſes were committed: and on the other ſide, that if the people haue willingly choſen me, to be the claimer and challenger of their libertie, what other thing can men ſay: what ſhall the ſtraunge nation ſpeake: and what ſhal poſteritie report but this, that there was in me ſomething, worthie of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and freendſhip, and in them ſomewhat worthie of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treeme hatred? I confeſſe then, that I am, and that I wil al my life long be popular, that is to ſaie, that I will purſue, mainteine and defende, your libertie and your priuiledges. Thus you ſee, howe theſe wiſe braines, are vtterly voide of common wit and vnderſtanding, and howe that euen then when they blame me they praiſe me. True it is, that fiue or ſix ill aduiſed perſons ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, being the enimies of your libertie, whoſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles, imaginations, and ſecret thoughtes, tende altogether to this, to ſeeke out the wayes, to make you ſubiect to their tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, which ſhould be more cruell, or at the leaſt more vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and more ſlauiſhe, then that of the Spaniardes hath bin: that theſe men I ſaie, meaſure the braine of all the worlde, by the elne of their owne vnderſtanding, and thincke that euerie one, will condemne that as euill, which they iudge to be ſo. But when the whole matter ſhalbe weighed at the common beame and balaunce, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhall finde that they haue great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſrekoned them ſelues.

But whome ſhall they be able to perſwade, that a people beaten with ſuch long warre (which cannot be without a million of inconueniences) would refuſe a peace, if it were reaſonable? Or that good, yea very good ſubiectes, and ſuffering very much, would refuſe to agree, with their ſuperior, except it be, when they ſee that ſuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, are baites to catche them? ſuch a peace is worſe then warre: and ſuch ſweete hony of the tongue, is more to be doubted, then the ſteelie edge of ſwordes.

            <p>They thinke the vnion of the Prouinces, made at Vtrecht, to be wonderfully wicked and euill. And why ſo? Becauſe that

            <p>And becauſe (my Lords) he proceedeth alſo, to bring the droppes of this infamous Proſcription vpon your heads, ſo far of is it, that you ſhall be moued therewith, that ye ſhoulde ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke, that herein the Spaniarde and his adherentes, follow the naturall diſpoſition of women, who, after that they haue wept, ſcratched and bitten, doe for their laſt remedie and refuge, come to iniuries and reuilinges: and euen ſo doth your enimie, now yeelde out his laſt barkinges: and if we giue them proofe, of our conſtancie, reſolution, and courage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde they are, at the laſt of their miſerable and wretched en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes. For, Sylla, Carbo, Marius, Antonius, and ſuch other tyraunts, the firſt fathers of theſe abhominable Proſcriptions, neuer gaue example to the Spaniardes, to commit ſuch follie and beaſtlineſſe, albeit that they haue traced out before them, that example of crueltie and barbarouſneſſe, which theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretches haue accompliſhed and perfourmed: But they proſcribed ſuch only as were fugitiues, driuen away, hidden in ſecret, and that within the countreys, ouer which they had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb facs="tcp:7223:55"/>and authoritie. And theſe men are like vnto them in this, that is to ſay, in crueltie, becauſe they proſcribe, good, vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and honourable perſonages: but yet in this point, they ſhew themſelues ſottiſh and fooliſh, that they proſcribe him, whome they ſhould fight againſt, with an armed power. For, to ſende a poiſoner, as the Duches of Parme ſent one: or to ſend a murtherer, as hir ſonne, the generall heire of the vertues of his aunceſtors, did: this is not the effect of a Proſcription, but of briberie, and the euerie rather.</p>
            <p>Beholde (my Lordes) not what I am able to ſay, againſt this tyrannous Proſcription, but what I haue thoughte meete for this time: ſpeaking vnto you, which haue the knowledge, of ſundrie thinges, that I omit, becauſe they are known vnto you, and becauſe alſo, that if I would attempt, to ſpeake of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular enterpriſes, of the King, and of his cheefe Officers, I ſhould aſſaie to doe that, which no Orator is ſufficiently able, worthely to deſcribe: yea that, which no good man, was euer able to conceaue: ſo great is their crueltie, tyrannie, and all maner of vniuſt dealing. Notwithſtanding I hope, that as well by the matter contained in this Proſcription (which is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient teſtimonie, of their ouer baſe and abiect courage) as by my aunſwere you ſhall ſufficiently know, what are their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious purpoſes, and miſerable attemptes: and by this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, you ſhall alſo learne, what it is neceſſary, for you, to caſt your eye vpon, and diligently to vnderſtande: that is, that they diſpaire, that euer they ſhall be able to vanquiſh you by force, and therefore they aſſay to ſow diuiſion amongſt vs, magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cheefly thoſe, who haue not only forſaken vs, againſt their othe: but euen haue left vs in perillous times, and namely, whileſt that one of our Townes was beſieged: whereof they are not able, to make any iuſt complaint, nor alleadge their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed pretext and cloake, yea (which alſo is the heape, of all diſloialtie and vnfaithfulneſſe) at the very ſame time they come to aſſault vs, in other places and quarters. As for the threats annexed in this Proſcription, tende to no other ende, but to aſtoniſh you, to the end you might ſeperate your ſelues from me: and plainely to declare, that they make war againſt
<pb facs="tcp:7223:56"/>me, and not againſt you, euen as the woolfe woulde perſwade the ſheepe, that he had not war with any but with the dogges, which being once diſcomfited, he would eaſilie agree with the ſlocke of ſheepe: for the dogges were alwayes the authours, of their debate and combatting. But (my Lordes) though I were abſent: though I were departed into Germanie, would they burne no more? would they ſpill no more blood? would they drown no more? Was the libertie of the Countrey main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by that gentle and milde man, the Duke of Alua? Did they not then wickedly put to death in Spaine, your owne Ambaſſadors my Lords of Bergues, and of Montigni? Did they not at the ſame time, ſet before your eyes, vppon ſpeares and launces, the heads of your principall Captaines and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors? The other point, which they moſt ſet before them, is the extirpation of Religion. I minde not here (my Lords) to enter into this queſtion, which is the true Religion, wherein God is truely ſerued and called vpon, and that according to his worde: but leaue it rather to bee declared by others, more excerciſed in that matter than I: and yet ſo, that euery one may know by my profeſsion, what I beleeue concerning the ſame. But this I cannot chuſe but tell you, that ſuch is the eſtate of your countrey, that without the exerciſe and free vſe of the ſayd Religion, it cannot ſtande three dayes. You ſee the number of them that profeſſe it, maruailouſlie increaſed: you ſee that hatred agaynſte the Pope, is inrooted deepelie, in the hartes of all the inhabitauntes of the Countrey, becauſe that his damnable practiſes, agaynſte this whole eſtate, are manifeſtly diſcouered.</p>
            <p>Who is he then, that can boaſt that he loueth the Countrey, and woulde giue counſell to driue away ſuch a great number of people, which once departing, ſhall leaue the Countrey, waſte, poore, and miſerable, and ſhall people and inriche the ſtraunge nations about vs? But ſuppoſe, that they will not departe, or voyde the Countrey, who is hee that can inforce them ſo to doe? let vs looke vppon our neighbours: Lette vs conſider our owne examples, and if wee bee not vtterlye voyde of witte and vnderſtanding, wee will neuer
<pb facs="tcp:7223:56"/>chuſe ſuch pernitious and hurtfull counſels, as ſhall vtterlie, euen from toppe to toe, bring to ruine and deſtruction, this eſtate. I will yet ſay ſomewhat more vnto you (my Lordes) that albeit that amongſt them, which follow the Romane church, there are ſundrie good people, and louers of their Countrey: and that amongeſt them, there are ſome alſo, whiche haue moſt honourablie acquited and behaued themſelues: yet notwithſtanding thoſe of the Religion, are very well aſſured of this, that there ſhall neuer be found any amongeſt them, who hath had intelligence, or made any practiſe with the enimie, but all of them generally, haue bin contrarie vnto him. And albeit that ſome haue bin founde amongeſt them, who being like vnto wanton and proude children, haue brought thorow their vnheedineſſe, ſome trouble into the houſe: yet for all that, they haue not had any dealing, with the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Seeing then (my Lordes) that you knowe their purpoſes and attemptes, there reſteth no other thing but this, that you doe in time prouide for them, and labour what ye can, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe the ſame. And how ſhall this be perfourmed? forſooth by this meanes, that ye performe in effect, that which ye haue alwayes in your mouth: and that which the marke of your ſheafe of arrowes ſignifieth, which it hath pleaſed you to haue grauen in your ſeale: that is to ſay, that no member of this goodlie bodie, reſpecte that which is his owne, but regard the whole bodie altogether: that ſome one parte of the bodie, take not vnto it ſelfe that meate, whiche is prepared for the whole, but that it ſuffer the ſtomacke (whiche is the counſell, that yee ſhall ordaine and appoint) to concoct and digeſt the ſame, and to ſende it by the vaynes, to all the members of this eſtate, and ſpeciallie, that whereſoeuer any diſeaſe or ſickneſſe ſhall appeare, the Phiſitions ſhoulde ſpeedilie be ſente thither, and that the Patientes ſhoulde quietlie beare for a time, the miſeries vppon them, that ſo they maye feele at the length, a ioyfull deliueraunce, from their diſeaſe and euill. Shall not this be a iuſt reproche vppon vs and oures, for euer, if that, hauing ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an eſtate vnder our power, and ſo goodlie meanes
<pb facs="tcp:7223:57"/>for our defence, we doe, thorow a miſerable couetouſneſſe and greedie deſire, to get vnto our ſelues ſome commodities, and that with the preiudice and hurte of our countrey men and friends, whileſt ſome draw one way, and other ſome an other: if wee doe I ſaye, finde our ſelues and that in a moment, ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ouerwhelmed by our deadly enimies? Remember (my Lordes) I pray you, the very great diminiſhing and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this eſtate, which came to paſſe after the death of Duke Charles, which fell vpon vs for no other thing, but becauſe that while the Prouinces, buſied themſelues, to contende and to fight one of them againſt another, for certaine pretended priuiledges, and for certaine commodities, the reſt was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and forſaken. Thinke not that it is in my power (the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires and matters being in ſuch condition as they are) any long time to reſiſt the enemie, with ſuch ſmall and ſlender meanes, as you (my Lordes) know, that I haue had in my hand and poſſeſsion. But on the other ſide, if I haue any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or practiſe, of gouernment and warre: if I knowe this Countrey, and the meanes that the enemie hath, though that all the armies and powers, whiche they threaten ſhall come the nexte yeare, out of Spaine and Italie, ſhoulde come vpon vs and our powers, they ſhal doe no more, but much leſſe rather, then the Duke of Alua did in Holland and Zeland. And if it be in your power to take order for this (as it is indeede) and yet notwithſtanding ye doe it not: by what name ſhall a man call this fault, if it be committed by you (my Lordes) who are here aſſembled, and vpon whome, all the good people of this countrey ſtay themſelues, eſteeming you as their fathers, and their Protectors, who will alſo willingly imbrace, as ſome ioyfull newes ſent from heauen, any good order which you ſhall decree and eſtabliſh? Wherefore take pitie of your ſelues, and if that which concerneth your ſelues moue you not, yet take pitie I pray you of ſo many poore people alreadie deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and more like to be: of ſo many poore widowes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe children: of ſo many murthers and ſlaughters, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted within the bowels of your owne countrey: of ſo many Churches deſtroyed: and of ſo many Paſtors wandering vp
<pb facs="tcp:7223:57"/>and downe together with their poore flockes. Set before you, that cruell and barbarous execution, committed at Niuelle, by the Countie of Mansfeld Which thinges you may eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide, and caſt all the euill and miſcheife of this warre, vppon the enemie, if only you remoue partialities and partakinges, and with one courage and hart as it were, imploye together all the meanes that you haue, without ſparing, I ſay, not the bottome of your purſes, but that whiche aboundeth therein. And as concerning that which particularly toucheth my ſelfe, you ſee (my Lordes) that it is this head, that they ſeeke for, the which by ſuch a price, and ſo great a ſumme of money, they haue vowed and appointed to death and ſaye, that ſo long as I ſhall be amongeſt you, the warres ſhall haue no ende. Would to God (my Lordes) either that my perpetuall baniſhment, or elſe my very death it ſelfe, might bring vnto you, a found and true deliueraunce, from ſo many miſcheifes and calamities as the Spaniardes (whome I haue ſeene, ſo many times deliberate in counſell, deuiſe and ſpeake of particularly, and whome I know within and without) doe deuiſe againſt you, and prepare for you. O how ſweete ſhould this baniſhment be vnto mee? O how delitefull ſhould this death be vnto me? for wherefore is it, that I haue giuen ouer, yea loſt all my goods? is it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riche my ſelfe? Wherefore haue I loſt mine owne bretheren, whome I loued more then mine owne life? Is it that I might finde ſome other elſe where? Wherefore haue I ſo long time left my ſonne a priſoner, my ſonne I ſay, whome I oughte ſo much to deſire, If I be a father? is it becauſe you are able to giue me an other? or becauſe you are able to reſtore him to me againe? Wherefore haue I put my life ſo oftentimes in daunger? what other recompence, what other rewarde, can I looke for, of my long trauailes, which haue come vpon me for your ſeruice ſake, euen ſo farre, that they haue brought vppon me olde age, and the ruine and loſſe of all my goods, excepte it be to purchaſe and to procure you libertie, and that if neede be, with the price of my blood. If you therefore (my Lords) do iudge either that my abſence, or that my very death it ſelfe, may ſerue you, or ſtande you in any ſteede, beholde I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb facs="tcp:7223:58"/>to obey, commaunde me, yea ſend me euen to the worlds ende, and I will obey you. Beholde, my head ouer whiche no Prince nor Monarche, hath any power, ſaue you only, diſpoſe thereof as ſhall make moſt for your owne good, and for the health and preſeruation of your common wealth. But if you iudge, that this meane experience and ſmall diligence that is in me, and which I haue attained, by ſo long and ſo continuall trauell: If you iudge that the remainder of my goods, and that my life it ſelfe, may as yet ſerue you (as in deede I doe wholie dedicate and conſecrate the ſame vnto the countrey) reſolue then vpon the pointes, which I propound vnto you and ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. And if you thinke that I beare any loue to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and that I haue any ſufficiencie in me, to giue counſel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that this is the only meane, to aſſure, yea to deliuer our ſelues from the enemie. This being done, let vs with one hart and good wil go together, and let vs together imbraſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this good people, which demaundeth nothing elſe, but to haue good counſels laide open before them, nor deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth any thing elſe, but to follow the ſame: And this doing, if you yet continue towardes me the fauour, whiche heretofore you haue borne me, I hope by your aide, &amp; Gods grace (which I haue ſo often heretofore felt, and that in very perplexed and doubtfull matters) that that which ſhall be reſolued vpon, by you, ſhall be, for the good, and preſeruation, of your ſelues, your wiues and children, and all ſacred and holie thinges.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7223:60"/>of Holland, Zeland, Vtrecht and of Burgundy, and withall, of our counſell of eſtate, beſtowing vppon him ſundrie benefites and honours, whereby both by reaſon of the othe of fidelitie and homages, which he hath likewiſe made vnto vs, becauſe alſo of the fees, penſions, landes and Lordſhips, helde of vs in diuers our Countreis and Prouinces, he was greatlie ſubiected and bound to obey vs, to keepe and holde his faith giuen, and to procure the good and profite of our affaires, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to maintaine, all quietneſſe and peace in our eſtates and countreyes. Notwithſtanding euery one knoweth, that we were not ſo ſoone departed, out of thoſe our low Countreyes, but that the ſayd William of Naſſau, made Prince of Orange by the meanes aboue mentioned, did by his ſiniſter practiſes, deuiſes and craftes aſſaie, firſte, to get the good willes of thoſe whome he knew to be diſcontent, greatly indebted, haters of iuſtice, ſtudious of nouelties, and ſpeciallie ſuch as were ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be of the religion, bancketting them, prouoking them, and drawing them after him, by faire wordes, promiſes, and vaine perſwaſions, euen ſo farre, that he was the principall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, promotor and framer, of the firſt requeſt, preſented by certaine companies of yong Gentlemen, who did dayly fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent his houſe and table: yea that the very plot thereof, was layde in his ſaide houſe, by and with the aſsiſtaunce of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Ludouick of Naſſau his brother a great heretick.

And afterward paſsing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſaid requeſt, &amp; proceeding further, he &amp; his adherents, brought in hererical preachings, &amp; publick aſſemblies in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie places of our ſaide countreis, whiles that the Dutches of Parma, our moſt dere &amp; beſt beloued ſiſter (the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Regentes and general Gouernes of our ſaid low countreis) had ſent vnto vs, that we might giue order co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ſaid requeſt.

Notwithſtanding, ſo ſoone as the ſaid Naſſau, was entered and receaued into the ſaid gouernment, he began by his officers &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plices, to bring in heretical preachings in euery place where he could, perſecuting all the good paſtors, preachers, religious perſons, and honeſt people, whereof hee droue away a great number, and amongſt them he cauſed manie of them to bee murthered or elſe wincked at the murther, that was made of them, by ſome of his adherentes vntill ſuch time as the ſaid E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, being greatlie offended with this crueltie, would haue a reaſon and an account yeelded thereof. but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he feigned that
<pb facs="tcp:7223:61"/>the thing did much diſpleaſe and diſlike him, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding afterwards, he returned to his firſt purpoſe &amp; marke, ill intreating thoſe, which he knew to be Catholicks, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his attemptes, arding himſelfe with the councell of hereticall Miniſters, as well ſtraungers, as of the ſaid countrey, chaunging likewiſe the Magiſtrates, which he knew ſauoured not his enterpriſes and purpoſes, and afterwardes proceeded to bring in libertie of conſcience, or (to ſpeake truclie) confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of religion. Wherevpon immediately after it fell out, that the Catholickes were openly perſecuted, caſt downe, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen away: the Churches and Monaſteries both of men and women broken downe, ruinated, and made euen with the earth: the religious perſons both men and women euill hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, baniſhed and rooted out, vnleſſe they woulde play the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatates, &amp; become maried, for in the other he had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence at all (as alſo he himſelfe, being before a maried man, his ſeconde wife yet liuing, did take a religious woman and an Abbais, ſolemnely bleſſed by the Biſhops hand, whome hee as yet keepeth with him, the moſt ſhamefaſt and infamous thing that can be, not only according to chriſtian religion, but alſo by the lawes of the Romanes, and againſt all honeſtie) and at the laſt, hath proceeded ſo far, that he hath not lefte any more place for the catholick religion, ſuffring all the errors and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, of all other ſectes and hereſies, that he might there by, ouerthrow and roote vp (if he would) our catholick and holy religion, which hath bin alwayes obſerued by the whole eſtate of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, he hath cauſed our poore ſubiectes of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande and Zelande, to be ſo ſuſſe, and brought them to ſtande vpon ſuch termes, that almoſt all the townes thereof, one after an other, haue bin beſieged and taken, ſome by aſſault, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome by compoſition and yeelding, in ſo much that more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once, he hath bin almoſt vtterly driuen out by our armies, vntill ſuch time that, the great commaunder of Caſtile, being dead, whome we alſo made ſucceſſor in that gouernment after the ſayd Duke of Alua, whome wee called backe from thence, that wee mighte make out ſubiectes more contented thereby,
<pb facs="tcp:7223:61"/>thinges came into ſome diſorder, and diſobedience of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, who tooke the towne of Ziriczee, which diſorder began to giue ſome fauour to the ſaid Naſsau: and immediately after, the eſtates generall of our ſaide Countreis, in thoſe quarters, (deſiring once to get out of theſe miſeries of warre, perſwaded by the ſayde Orange, ſaying and feigning that, he deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the good peace and tranquilitie of the countreyes, and to ſet them free from ſtraunge ſouldiars, and to holde the countrey vnder our obedience, and withall to preſerue therin, the auncient catholick religion, ſuch as it had alwayes bin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed and practiſed amongeſt them, and to keepe the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and libertie of the ſaide countrey) did make with him the treatie of Gaundt, eſtabliſhed expreſly vppon theſe two grounds, that is, to maintaine the ſaid religion, and obedience to vs.</p>
            <p>While theſe thinges were in handling, wee ſent our good brother, the late Lord Don Iohn of Auſtria, of bleſſed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, with commaundement and intention to pacifie, reconcile, and accord, all the troubles of our ſaid countreis, by the moſte gentle mean, and fauourableſt way that could be, which thing alſo he did, yeelding vnto our ſubiectes euery thing, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maner of way, might be graunted vnto them, ratifying and confirming alſo, the ſaid treatie of Gaunt, which he cauſed to be publiſhed in euery place, according to the accuſtomed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which the foreſaide Orange did gaineſay, by all the forces and power he had, but not being able to hinder it, hee woulde neuer afterwardes cauſe the ſame to be publiſhed, in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his gouernments (fretting as is ſaide becauſe he was not able to lette it) notwithſtanding that we our ſelues had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards approued, confeſſed, and confirmed both the one and the other agreement and treatie, and notwithſtanding that our ſayd good brother (together with the deputies of the reſt of the eſtates, had ſent diuers great and good perſonages, to the ſayd Orange, to perſwade him to that, to the end effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie to accompliſh on his part, that wherevnto he was helde and bound, by the articles and pointes, of the ſaid treatie of Gaunt. And becauſe, that he pleaded and alleaged continually
<pb facs="tcp:7223:62"/>that he ought to recouer his whole gouernment, and withall, that the townes which would not acknowledge him for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, or elſe thoſe, which afterwards we had taken by force of armes, and brought by ſome other meanes into our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhould be put vnder his ſayd gouernment, he was euen in that alſo ſatisfied, by the goodneſſe and gentleneſſe of our ſaid eſtates, who had not yet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſufficiently known his deceits and periuries yet ſo notwithſtanding, that he ſhold ſweare that he would change nothing at al, of the forme of the ſaid ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, catholique and Romane religion, and that for this purpoſe, he ſhould giue ſuch aſſurances &amp; ſatisfactions, as the magiſtrates, Burgeſſes and inhabitauntes of euerie towne, might iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde. Wherevpon they, hauing reaſoned a long while, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the aſſurances, which euerie towne did demaund, to the end that that which the ſayde Orange promiſed them, might be obſerued and kept, they were ſubiected vnder his gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after that he had ſworne to performe the pointes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd, and other articles contayned in the inſtrumentes and writinges of the ſayd ſatisfactions and aſſuraunces. But, ſo far of was it, that he hath kept and obſerued his foreſayd promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes &amp; othes, that, on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie ſide, he immediately brought into the ſaid countreis and townes; his miniſters and Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtes, preachers, he hath cauſed the heretickes, that were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, to return, he hath there practiſed libertie of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, and hath cauſed to be committed, ſome offences in ſome chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ioyning himſelfe, firſt to the poorer ſorte, and afterwards to the magiſtrates, and hath by little and little, perſecuted the good paſtors, and cauſed them to flie away: finally, hee hath expelled and baniſhed the whole catholick religion, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the exerciſe and vſe thereof. In doing of which, hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ordinarie hipocriſies, and accuſtomed counterfeiting, ſaying that thoſe thinges diſpleaſed him, and that hee was not able to remedy the ſame. And yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he did, both by himſelf, and by his Officers ſecretely, and as it were vnder hand prouoke, all the ſeditious and hereticall perſons, to vſe &amp; practiſe the miſcheefe he had conceaued: and for this cauſe he did (by the aide and aſsiſtaunce of thoſe of his ſide) place by
<pb facs="tcp:7223:62"/>little and little, garriſons within the townes, againſt his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes and promiſes ſworne, and in the meane while ceaſed not, to accuſe our ſayd Brother Don Iohn, that he priuily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed many miſchiefes againſt the Eſtates, whiche thing not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, our ſayd Brother hath alwayes aſſured vs not to be true. But rather that ſeing the obſtinacie and malices of the ſayd Orange, he might be able to impart the ſame matter with others, and to deuiſe how, they might bring him to reaſon, and hinder him, from againe troubling the whole publique quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of the ſaid countreis, as afterwardes he did indeede.</p>
            <p>All this notwithſtanding, the foreſaid Orange left not of, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that by his practiſes and ſubtil ſleights (which are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to him) he had ſet ſuch great diffidence &amp; diſtruſt, between our ſaid brother, &amp; the eſtates of our ſaid countreys, that there appeared nothing, but a moſt great, euident, and apparaunt murther. In ſo much that, for the auoiding of that diſorder, or at the leaſt to eſcape the impriſonment of his own perſon, the ſayd Don Iohn, placed himſelf ſafelie, in our town &amp; Caſtle of Namure. Wherevnto he was ſo much the more mooued, by how much he was not any whit at all armed, and on the other ſide, becauſe it was manifeſt &amp; certaine, that the ſayd Orange, by al his poſting meſſengers and officers, did not ceaſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the factious perſons, to practiſe the like thing, vppon his owne perſon, as he had the ſame yeare cauſed to bee practiſed, vpon thoſe of our councell of eſtate, appointed to the generall gouernement, of our ſayde Countreis: as alſo, becauſe that then the ſayd Orange, thinking that he had gotten all, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſhoote out all his arrowes, and to diſcouer his ſleightes and weapons, that he might draw our people into open warre, agaynſt our ſayde brother and Lieuetenaunt generall. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, by occaſion of ſome good men, being nigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his perſon, and of other vertuous people, on the eſtates ſide, the matters came ſo farre, that all was well agreede, and that for the auoiding of all occaſion and diſtruſt, it was both on the one ſide, and on the other concluded, that hee ſhoulde withdraw himſelfe from his gouernement, and go into Italy, which thing alſo we our ſelues wiſhed and willed: And there
<pb facs="tcp:7223:63"/>were with him, the Deputies of the Eſtates, mutually to accept and to ſigne, the offers made on both ſides, one of them to an other. But in ill time, this enimie, the common diſturber of publike quietneſſe (who knowing that from the place of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land where he was, he could not with all his deuices any more hinder this peace and reconciliation) made haſte to come at that very time to Bruxelles, and feigning that he woulde haue peace, he procured warre, ſetting downe new conditions, not yet talked nor conferred of, nor opened, in ſo muche that hee obtained his purpoſe, breaking the whole agreement, as euery one very well knoweth. Afterwardes, the matter being come to a breaking out, of open and moſt cruell warre, he by force and tumult of the people, cauſed himſelfe, againſte the good will of the Eſtates, to be declared, Rewart, that is, the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor or defendor of our Countrey of Brabant, and afterwards the ſeconde Lieuetenaunt of all our low countreis, and alſo in fine he cauſed himſelfe by the tumultes of Gaunt and of ſome other places, to be choſen gouernour of Flaunders: hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo cauſed to come thither, his brother, and brother in law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtraungers, to take vpon them, ſome other gouernmentes, of our Prouinces, and yet notwithſtanding, hee and his parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, burthen our people, withall ſortes of impoſitions, exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, demaundes, leuies and taxes, ſo harde, barbarous and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous, that the like hath neuer bin heard of, which he hath executed, by a ſtrong hand and force of armes, without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of our people, and without yeelding any account thereof: and if any man ſpeake of theſe thinges, he layeth hande vpon them, or cauſeth them to be ſpoyled, euill intreated, impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or ſlaine.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide it is manifeſt, what wee haue continually done, to pacifie and quiet (ſo ſoone as we vnderſtoode there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) the euill that fell out, as hath bin ſayd, betweene our ſayde Lieuetenaunt generall and the eſtates. But all the good that we haue done, or our ſayd brother, hath bin ſuppreſſed and hid, in ſteed whereof the ſayd Orange and his partakers, haue deuiſed a thouſande ſlaunders, the more to abuſe our ſaid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. Euen as in the obtaining of the victorie of Gembloux,
<pb facs="tcp:7223:63"/>when we ſent the Baron of Seelles, with moſt reaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that he might receaue into fauour our ſaid Subiectes, and accord the whole matter, nothing for all that followed therevpon, by meanes of the hinderaunce and let, whiche hee knew to caſt in the way, albeit, that all this while, our ſaid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, writing both to vs, and to our good brother and nephew the Emperour, and other Potentates, to iuſtifie the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which they had againſt our ſaid Lieuetenaunt generall, did openly proteſt, that they ment not to change any thing, in the auncieut, catholicke, and Romane religion, ſuche as it had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bin obſerued, in our ſaid countreis, and withall, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the practiſe thereof, they would yeelde vs that obedience which by Gods law and mans law, was due vnto vs, whiche were the only two points which we alwayes demaunded, and demaunded then of them, and whereof alſo we were agreede. Notwithſtanding the ſayd Orange, fearing the reconciliation of our ſubiects with vs, came ſo farre, that he layd agayn newe deuiſes, not only for to hinder that matter, but alſo to make (if he could) for euer, the thing paſt hope of recouerie, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together remedileſſe, by going about to corrupt all with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, wherevnto he attained in diuers places, both by ſubtelties, craftes, miſcheefes, and periuries, well known to him and all heretickes, and alſo by meere force, vſing the ſame that he had practiſed before, to waſt and deſtroy the prouinces of Holland and Zeland, caſting all into the fire of popular tumult, and of the ſacking of churches, prophanations of ſacramentes, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or impriſonment of Biſhops, Paſtors, Ieſuites, religious men, religious women, and of ſundrie ſecular parſons, of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and honour, breaking againſt all order of lawe the priue-ledges, vſages, and auncient obſeruations, depriuing the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Councellors, gouernours of places, Bailiffes Prouoſtes, Sheriues, and other catholicke officers, well affected to vs, and the good and quiet of the Countrey, placing in their ſteede, and that extraordinarilie and by his owne authoritie, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes by the tumult of the people prouolied by him (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt whome he raigneth and triumpheth) all ſectaries, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions men and turbulent perſons, liuing of pray and ſpoile,
<pb facs="tcp:7223:64"/>and others like vnto himſelf, in ſo much that he hath brought all to the moſt tirannous, barbarous and bloodie confuſion, that euer yet was heard of. Wherewith certaine catholick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces being diſpleaſed, euen to ſee the conſciences of the good ſo oppreſſed, and violently inforced, and the churches, Cloyſters, Abbayes, Caſtles, and houſes of Noble men and great perſonages, laid flat with the earth, and their goods gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for a praye to all wicked men, at the diſcretion and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this ſtraunger, and the whole eſtate of the countrey ſubuerted by him, yea ſo farre that hee meante to conſtraine whole prouinces, and that againſte their othe and good will, they did willingly reconcile themſelues to vs, which thing hee indeauored on all ſides, to gainſaye and hinder, but they were more ſtrong and conſtant then he, yea, which is worſe, albeit that the ſaide Lorde Emperour at the earneſt requeſt of the ſayde Eſtates (who beſought him to bee an interceſſour, and to make a meane for a pacification betweene vs and them) was content to take the whole matter into his owne handes, and to determine it, if he coulde: wherevnto for the deſire that we haue, to ſee our people deliuered from theſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we did willingly condiſcende and agree. And indeede, his Imperiall Maieſtie, ſent to this purpoſe, his Commiſsioners to Colen, as wel Princes Electors, as others very principal perſons of the holy Empire, to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the points in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie and diſpute betweene vs, yet that hath no whit at all turned him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, nor with-held him, from his wicked &amp; peruerſe purpoſes. And indeed, the ſaid Commiſsioners, hauing heard the whole matter, &amp; debated a good while together vpon the demaunds of the ſaid eſtates and our offers made therto, reſolued &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, the points &amp; articles which they cauſed to be publiſhed and imprinted, that they might be accepted both of the one ſide and the other. Neuertheleſſe, the whole matter was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any effect or fruit, notwithſtanding that the articles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues were ſo gracious, fauorable, iuſt, &amp; reaſonable, that there is no man of good iudgement, but he confeſſeth, that they are more then ſufficient, and that we haue offered more, then by any reaſon our ſubiects ought to demaund at our handes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7223:64"/>
            <p>Whileſt this conference and communication endured and laſted, the ſaid Orange, to the end that he might countermine &amp; worke againſt the Emperour and vs, and ſo by that meanes, make all the matter deſperate and paſt hope, cauſed to bee made in Vtrecht, a certaine aſſemblie of the deputies of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry townes and countreies, which he keepeth vnder his owne power, there to practiſe a new league, or a manifeſt and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſpiracie, againſt the ſaide religion and vs, with execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deteſtable both wordes and othes, not abſtaining to iniury the commiſsioners of the ſaide Lorde Emperoure For which purpoſe he was aſsiſted, by his ſaide brother, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law, and other helpers, which thing alſo he hath wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and wrong from fundry quarters, by great prouocation, practiſes, ſclaunders, and importunate promiſes, yea, almoſt by force And notwithſtanding all the duties perfourmed by the ſaide commiſsioners, to cauſe the prouinces to vnderſtand their ſaide good and holy reſolution, ſo profitable for our ſubiectes, hee by his adherentes, and certaine ſuppoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which he vſeth for inſtrumentes, hath brought to paſſe that the ſaide articles, were a long while ſuppreſſed and kept cloſe, and when they could not any longer be hidden, he hath not only hindered, that they ſhould not be accepted, but hath procured, that certaine pernitious bookes, ſtuffed with all lies and ſklaunders ſhould be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt them. And moreouer at the laſt, the deputies that he hath in Antwerp, nigh aboute him, beyng of the ſame profeſsion, haue demaunded articles more greeuous, impertinent, hurtfull, offenſiue, and full of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety agaynſt God and vs, their ſoueraigne Lord and naturall Prince, yea ſuch articles, as a man cannot ſpeake to much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt them. Beſides, when hee perceaued, that as yet hee could not by all his cunning perſwaſions and laboures wholly obtaine the ſame, he determined with him ſelfe at the length to depart out of Antwerp (from whence hee had not ſtarred by more then two yeares ſpace) &amp; went into our ſaid towne of Vtrecht, to the ende hee might accompliſh the execution of the ſaide damnable league, and make for euer all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnremediable. And generallie, hee hath ſo behaued him ſelfe in all manner of tyrannie, that he hath driuen from
<pb facs="tcp:7223:65"/>thence and rooted out al the people of the church, yea he hath ſo handled the Lordes, and the whole principall Nobilitie of our countries, that they haue bin inforced to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and to forſake their countries, to the ende that hee may raigne and rule there, moſt abſolutelie, amongeſt the furies and tumultes of the people the good being chaſed away. And becauſe that all this confuſion and curſe, that our countries ſuffer, is confeſſed to proceede from the counſell, exhortation, prouocation, and doing of this wicked hipocrite, by meanes of his vnquiet ſpirite, which alſo placeth the whole felicitie thereof, in the trouble of our ſubiectes: and withall ſeeing that it is manifeſt, that ſo long as he is in our Countreis, there cannot be peace, reſt, nor any quietneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſtabliſhing all vpon a perpetuall diſtruſt which he hath euer in his mouth (a very ordinary and common thing to wicked men, who haue their conſciences vexed and troubled, as had Caine, Iudas and ſuche like) moreouer, ſeing that notwithſtanding the intreaties and offers, that hath bin made him, euen by the Emperors Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners, offering him moſt great profits, to the end that he would returne to his natiue countrey (where euery one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ought to deſire to liue moſt) he would not accept thereof, and being a ſtraunger, delighteth rather to deſtroy our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis, then to yeelde to that, which is reaſonable and good, for the benefite of our naturall ſubiectes the inhabitauntes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

And that they may the more ſpeedily come to haue ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, againſt their ſaid perſon or goods, it ſhall be proofe ſufficient ynough to declare, that they haue ſeene them, after the time expreſſed in this proſcription, communicate, ſpeake, treate, haunt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ſecretely with the ſaide Orange, or haue ſhewed him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular fauor, aſsiſtaunce or ayde, directly or indirectlie howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, pardoning notwithſtanding all men, whatſoeuer, euen vnto the ſaid time they ſhall haue done to the contrarie, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning backe, and ſubmitting themſelues agayne, vnder the due and lawfull obedience which they owe vnto vs, they haue accepted or ſhall accept the ſaid treatie of Arras, concluded at Monts, or the articles of the deputies of the Emperor deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined at Colen.</p>

            <p>YOV HAVE KNOWEN (MY LORDES) BY my life paſt, and by my behauiours, that I neuer mynded to anſweare to any libels of defamation, which certayne ſclaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers had publiſhed agaynſt me, in ſo much as if the quality &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the wrong, which hath bene done agaynſt mee by the proſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Kinge of Spaine, hath cauſed to be publiſhed, I had not as yet proceeded ſo farre, especially had it not bene that the maintenance of myne honoure, had requeſted the ſame of mee, as I haue more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly layed out the ſame in my defence, which I haue preſented vnto you. Since which time, there is come into my handes a letter very falſe and counterfayt by myne ennemy, which they ſay they intercepted, and I ſent to my lorde the Duke of Aniou, or (as they ſay) to the Duke of Alançon, whereof ſome perſonages amongeſt them, and that of greate qualitie alſo haue ſent copies, as well to certaine townes of our ſyde, and amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt vs, as to ſundry ſtrange &amp; forrain princes. This letter my Lordes is ſo fondly written (whether a man regarde the ſtile thereof or wil respect the matter therein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayned, which by the bare reading therof ſufficiently bewrayeth, that there is not in it any ſhew of truth) that ſuch an impudent deuiſe deſerueth no anſweare: as alſo God bee praiſed, there is not found a man amongest vs, which is any whit at al mooued therwith. On the other ſide, euery man hath knowen, that they had no other meaning hereby, but by ſuch miſtes &amp; ſmokes, to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the brightnes, by which their miſerable &amp; pernitious inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r againſt this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, hath bin diſcouered by the letters of Cardinal Granduell and others which you haue commaunded to be printed, after that you knew their handes, their ſignes, and their ſeales, and withall therby, to take vnto them ſelues an occaſion and matter, to caſt vp and ſpew out (acording to the manner of ſhameles women) ſlaunderous, and wicked ſpeeches, ful of lying. But ſo far of is it, that by this meanes, they haue (inrespect of me) obteined that which they prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, that on the other ſide, they haue done me greate pleaſure, in publiſhing ſuch follies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:7223:68"/>that thereby they do more and more iustify and verify my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſufficiently prouing them ſelues to be ſhameles lyers, moſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſlaunderers, and moſt fond falſifiers, which ſerueth more &amp; more to iuſtify (as I haue ſaide) myne innocencie, and to geue approbation to all my actions. For, ſeeing that all men know, that this ſhould be the beſt newes, that they could receaue or heare of, that I would forſake the countrey, and leaue it to them, I offered them (my Lordes) and you vnder my honour, do promiſe them to accompliſh it, if they bee able to proue in your preſences, that I haue at any time written, or commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be written, or ſent ſuch a letter, that preſently I will depart the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, and withdraw my ſelfe from it, without euer ſetting my ſelfe againſt them: and I promiſe them, euen vpon a ſimple or bare requeſt to ſend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch paſſeportes and ſafeconducts, and they alſo penned in ſuch order, as either they can or will demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. But yet this ſhalbe with this condition, that if they will not accept this ſo reaſonable an offer, all they which haue bin the authors of ſuch a writing, or which haue pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed it, or which haue ſent it, into the townes amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt vs, or to forraine Princes, and ſtraunge countreyes, ſhalbe held for lyers, ſlaunderers, and wicked ſpeakers, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede ſuch they are.</p>
